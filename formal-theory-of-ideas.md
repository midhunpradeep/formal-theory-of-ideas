# A Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure, Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive

## Abstract

We develop a rigorous formal theory of **ideas** built from a single primitive element via successive levels of abstraction. Starting from one fundamental primitive, we construct a hierarchy of abstraction systems culminating in a **minimal binary abstraction** framework. Each version of the theory (from a unary abstraction to a multi-modal extension, then to functional binary abstraction, and finally to a minimal binary system with pattern-based semantics) is defined with formal axioms, definitions, and theorems. We assume **only structural identity** of ideas – two ideas are identical if and only if their structural construction is identical – while deferring any notion of semantic equivalence to future research. A core result is that *abstraction chains are unique*: each idea can be generated by a unique sequence of abstractions, yielding a canonical form. We introduce a **δ-based complexity measure** that uniquely encodes the generative structure of each idea, ensuring that complexity values distinguish distinct ideas. Importantly, the framework **permits conceptual nonsense** – structurally well-formed but semantically meaningless combinations – as legitimate formal ideas, with justification for why including such nonsensical constructs is both necessary and illuminating. We draw connections to structuralist and constructivist philosophies, comparing our approach to set theory, type theory, and category theory. We examine implications for cognition (how thoughts can be composed), self-reference (how an idea might reference or apply to itself), and even the role of nonsense in thought. The tone throughout is rigorous and methodical: we carefully justify each step, highlight limitations at each stage, and remain appropriately skeptical about speculative interpretations. In closing, we discuss potential applications of this theory in knowledge representation, formal ontology, and the analysis of conceptual systems, while acknowledging that full semantic interpretation remains an open challenge.

## Introduction

What is the **structure of an idea**? Can we formalize ideas in the way mathematicians formalize numbers or sets, starting from first principles? This paper proposes a foundational theory in which all **ideas** are built from a **single primitive** through iterated abstraction operations. By "idea," we mean a unit of thought or concept, stripped of any presumed meaning and considered only in terms of its structural relations to other ideas. The motivation is analogous to foundational work in mathematics: just as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory builds all sets from the empty set ∅ via membership, and just as arithmetic builds all numbers from 0 via successor, we aim to build all ideas from a unique primitive via **abstraction**.

Our approach is **formal and structural**. We make **no assumptions about intrinsic meaning** – in fact, we explicitly *defer semantic equivalence* to future research. In this theory, two ideas are considered the *same* only if they have the same structure of construction. This principle is akin to the *axiom of extensionality* in set theory, which states that a set is completely determined by its elements ([Axiom:Axiom of Extension - ProofWiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Axiom:Axiom_of_Extension#:~:text=The%20Axiom%20of%20Extension%20is,determined%20by%20its%20%205)) ([Axiom:Axiom of Extension - ProofWiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Axiom:Axiom_of_Extension#:~:text=%24A%24%20and%20%24B%24%20are%20equal)). Here, an idea is completely determined by how it is constructed from the primitive via abstraction steps. We do not collapse or identify ideas based on any external interpretation or semantic content, only by their formal construction. This yields a purely **structural identity criterion**: ideas are *identical iff their construction tree is identical*.

Because we focus on structural form, our theory can be seen as an extreme form of **structuralism** applied to concepts. In the structuralist view (originating in linguistics and anthropology), elements gain identity through their relations rather than any intrinsic content ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=For%20Saussure%2C%20there%20are%20no,arbor%2Ftree%2Fsound%20image%2Fsignifier%20vs)). Saussure famously said *“in language there are only differences without positive terms”* ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=For%20Saussure%2C%20there%20are%20no,arbor%2Ftree%2Fsound%20image%2Fsignifier%20vs)), meaning that concepts (signifieds) and words (signifiers) are defined by their differences and relations within a structure, not by standalone meaning. Our formal ideas likewise have no "positive" content aside from their place in an abstract construction network. Any meaning they may eventually acquire would come from relations or interpretations external to the formal system. In a similar vein, **post-structuralist** thought (Derrida’s concept of *différance*, for example) holds that meaning is always deferred and arises from a web of differences ([Différance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance#:~:text=Diff%C3%A9rance%20is%20a%20French%20,relationship%20between%20text%20and%20meaning)). Our stance resonates with this: **semantic equivalence is deferred** – we will not declare two differently-constructed ideas “the same meaning” even if an external observer might interpret them similarly. Instead, we leave the issue of semantic mapping to future work, focusing here on the *generation and structure* of ideas, not their interpretation.

This approach also aligns with a formalist philosophy of mathematics exemplified by David Hilbert, who viewed mathematics as a symbolic game played with marks on paper devoid of intrinsic meaning ([David Hilbert (40+ Sourced Quotes) - Lib Quotes](https://libquotes.com/david-hilbert#:~:text=Mathematics,meaningless%20marks%20on%20a%20paper)). By analogy, our theory treats ideas as formal symbols (generated by rules) and manipulates them according to those rules. **Meaninglessness (in a semantic sense) is not only permitted but expected** at the formal level. This extends even to what one might call "nonsense" ideas – constructions that, if interpreted, might yield paradox or meaninglessness. In our formal system, such *conceptual nonsense is allowed and in fact formally representable*. We will argue that allowing nonsensical combinations (rather than forbidding them via type constraints or well-formedness restrictions) is beneficial: it gives the theory completeness in expression and mirrors certain aspects of creative thought and philosophical inquiry, where exploring beyond the bounds of immediate sense can be illuminating.

From a constructive standpoint, our theory is **built step by step** – it is inherently *constructivist*. We literally construct the universe of all possible ideas from nothing but one primitive. This echoes the constructivist epistemology (à la Piaget) where knowledge is built from primitive cognitive operations, and also *mathematical constructivism* where one builds mathematical objects from basic ones rather than assuming their existence. In our case, we assume the existence of a single undefined **primitive idea** (think of it as an "ur-idea" or an empty placeholder of thought) and an initial abstraction operation. Everything else must be obtained by applying allowable operations in sequence. As we progress, we will enrich the abstraction mechanism to increase expressive power:

- **Version 1 (Primitive and Unary Abstraction):** We start with the simplest system: one primitive idea and a single unary abstraction operator. This produces a linear “chain” of ideas $I_0, \delta(I_0), \delta(\delta(I_0)), \dots$ ad infinitum. We formalize this and prove that even in this simple system, each idea has a unique construction sequence. However, the expressive power is extremely limited (essentially just an infinite sequence with no branching).

- **Version 2 (Multi-Modal Unary Abstraction):** We extend the unary abstraction to multiple *modes*. Instead of one abstraction operation, we have a variety (possibly an infinite set) of unary operators, each representing a different “mode” or kind of abstraction. This yields a branching tree of ideas: from the primitive, one can abstract in mode A or mode B, etc., and then further abstract those results in various modes, and so on. We will see that the **abstraction chains remain unique** in this richer setting; essentially, each idea can be identified with a unique sequence of mode choices. This version is more expressive (able to produce a diverse tree of ideas), but still lacks any mechanism to *combine* two independent ideas – each new idea stems from exactly one prior idea.

- **Version 3 (Functional Binary Abstraction):** Here we introduce a fundamentally new operation: a **binary abstraction** that allows one idea to be applied to another, in a functional manner. In other words, any idea can now play the role of a *function* (an abstract operator) and be applied to any other idea (as an argument) to form a new idea. Formally, we introduce a binary constructor $\delta(X,Y)$ meaning "the abstraction of $Y$ under $X$" (or "idea $X$ applied to idea $Y$"). This dramatically increases the generative complexity: we can now combine separate branches of the abstraction tree, not just extend one branch. Version 3 thus subsumes the previous versions – for example, a unary mode from Version 2 can be represented as a special idea $F$ that when applied to $X$ (i.e. $\delta(F,X)$) mimics that mode of abstraction. The **function-argument structure** of $\delta(X,Y)$ also introduces *ordered pair* structures into our idea system. We show that, assuming no additional identifications (i.e. $\delta$ is treated as a *free* binary constructor), the uniqueness of abstraction representation still holds: each idea now has a unique construction tree (a rooted ordered tree) rather than just a chain. We also define a preliminary **complexity measure** – essentially a count or code based on the number of abstraction steps – and argue that it **uniquely determines the structure** of an idea. Intuitively, because each idea has a unique build sequence, one can encode this sequence (for instance, as a Gödel number or a binary string), and that encoding will be one-to-one with the idea itself. In formal terms, there exists an injective function $\delta^*$ (not to be confused with the operator $\delta$) mapping each idea to a natural number that represents its *complexity*. This numeric “complexity” is *generative*: it increases with each abstraction applied, and no two distinct ideas share the same complexity value. We will give a theorem to this effect. Version 3 is the first version in which **self-reference** becomes possible in a non-trivial way – an idea could be applied to itself, $\delta(X,X)$, without violating any formation rule (just as non-well-founded set theory permits $x \in x$ ([
Non-wellfounded Set Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonwellfounded-set-theory/#:~:text=The%20term%20non,Foundation%20Axiom))). Such an idea has a perfectly valid structural identity in our system (a node pointing to itself as both function and argument), even if it might seem semantically puzzling. This is an example of *conceptual nonsense that our theory allows*: a structure that classical type theory or well-founded set theory would ban can exist here. We discuss the ramifications of this and why allowing it does not produce inconsistency (since we have no global axioms like Foundation that it would violate), but instead provides a broader canvas to study the limits of abstraction.

- **Version 4 (Minimal Binary Abstraction with Pattern-Driven Semantics):** In the final version, we push the system to an extreme of simplicity: we reduce the generative basis to the *minimum*. In practice, Version 4 has **one single primitive idea** (the same one we started with) and **one single binary abstraction operator** $\delta(\cdot,\cdot)$ with no further distinctions. All the variety of idea constructions must now be encoded *within the binary structure itself*. For example, if in Version 2 we had modes A, B, C, now there are no named modes – we might instead represent what was “mode A applied to X” as some binary pattern $\delta(P,X)$ where $P$ is the primitive idea in a particular position, or some fixed pattern of $\delta$ involving $P$ that signifies that mode. The semantics in this version, to the extent we discuss semantics at all, will be **pattern-driven**: certain structural patterns of the binary tree are interpreted as corresponding to what were distinct abstraction modalities or meanings. Since the formal system still has no built-in semantics, this pattern interpretation is an external commentary – a glimpse at how one *might* assign meaning later. We will emphasize that within the formal theory, pattern recognition is the only guide to meaning: e.g., an idea of the form $\delta(P,X)$ might be given an interpretation (by an outside observer) distinct from $\delta(X,P)$, simply because of the structural position of $P$. Version 4 essentially presents the **universal structure of a rooted ordered tree with a unique atom at the leaves** (since any structure is composed of the primitive $P$ combined via $\delta$ nodes). It is a minimalist *algebra of ideas* with just one generator and one binary operation. Despite (or rather, due to) its minimalism, this version is the most *powerful and most general*. We will show that any idea from Version 3 (with specific functional abstractions) can be encoded as a structure in Version 4. Moreover, the uniqueness of abstraction chains and the injective complexity measure carry over – essentially because we have boiled the system down to an **initial algebra** on a single generator that yields unique (up to isomorphism) representations ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=signature%2C%20and%20this%20object%2C%20unique,5)). In this version, **conceptual nonsense is not just allowed but abundant** – without any restrictive typing or mode constraints, *any* binary combination of ideas (no matter how absurd it might seem conceptually) is a valid idea. We regard this as a feature: it forces us to confront the difference between *structural possibility* and *semantic plausibility*. The theory, being formal, catalogues all structural possibilities; actual meaningful concepts would be a (possibly small) subset of those, filtered by whatever semantic or pragmatic constraints operate in the mind or world. In philosophical terms, Version 4’s free-wheeling generativity echoes the post-structuralist idea of a play of signifiers unbounded by fixed meaning – a kind of unlimited semiosis where even "nonsense" signifier chains are part of the structure of thought.

Following the development of these four versions, we include a section on the **Philosophical Meaning** of the theory, where we discuss how this formal framework connects to broader philosophical ideas. We will draw parallels to **structuralism** (as mentioned, form over content), **constructivism** (building a world of ideas from scratch), **phenomenology** (the structures of consciousness and experience, possibly relating our primitive to a raw unanalyzed experience and abstraction to the act of intentionality or constitution of objects in consciousness), and **post-structuralism** (the inevitability of nonsense and the deferral of meaning). We will also examine intriguing implications for **thought and cognition**: for instance, if every complex thought corresponds to a unique abstraction chain, this resonates with the idea of a mental *language of thought* (LOT) where complex concepts have a combinatorial structure. Our theory guarantees uniqueness of such structure, which could relate to the cognitive notion of *canonical representations* of concepts. The role of **type theory** is also discussed: type theory in computer science and logic imposes restrictions to rule out nonsensical programs or statements (e.g. preventing one from adding a number to a truth value, which would be rejected as "nonsense" ([Principles of Dependent Type Theory](https://carloangiuli.com/courses/b619-sp24/notes.pdf#:~:text=type%02checker%20may%20reject%20as%20nonsense,scoped))). Our untyped approach deliberately relinquishes these restrictions to study the full space of expressions; we compare the pros and cons of these stances. **Self-reference** and paradoxes are touched upon: we consider how our system can represent self-referential ideas (which traditional hierarchies like Russell’s type theory forbid to avoid paradox) and what that means for consistency and meaning. We also reflect on the notion of **nonsense** itself: echoing Wittgenstein’s insight that there are things that can only be shown but not said, with outright nonsense sometimes pointing to the limits of language ([
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#:~:text=%E2%80%98Nonsense%E2%80%99%20became%20the%20hinge%20of,The%20quandary%20arises%20concerning%20the)) ([
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#:~:text=nonsensical,what%20can%20only%20be%20shown)). In our theory, nonsense ideas exist formally and we can *show* them (write their structure) even if we cannot *say* what they mean – perhaps a formal analog of Wittgenstein’s ladder (to be thrown away after climbing) ([
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#:~:text=nonsensical,what%20can%20only%20be%20shown)).

Finally, we explore **Applications** of this formal theory. The ideas include: using the theory as a foundation for **knowledge representation** in AI (with a uniform data structure for all concepts, and the guarantee of unique identifiers for concepts via the complexity measure); employing it in **formal ontology** and library science (to avoid ambiguous concept entries by ensuring structural uniqueness); connections to **type theory and programming language design** (perhaps inspiring more flexible type systems that can handle and reason about currently "nonsensical" programs, improving languages’ ability to manipulate code as data); **cognitive science and psychology** (modeling how children might build complex concepts from primitive ones, or how creative thought might combine concepts in novel ways – including nonsensical combinations that could later become meaningful metaphors); and **mathematics/computer science** (the theory can be seen as an initial algebra or term algebra, which has applications in theorem proving and symbolic computation – e.g. unique term representation is crucial in automated reasoning ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=Freely%20generated%20algebraic%20structure%20over,a%20given%20signature))). We will also mention potential use in analyzing **paradoxes and self-referential systems**: by representing them formally, we might separate the structural facet from the semantic, possibly shedding light on what makes certain self-referential ideas paradoxical. Throughout the applications, we maintain an "academically skeptical" tone – noting that while the formalism is intriguing and offers some clear benefits (like canonical forms), one must be cautious about how much “real world” insight it directly yields, given that we have intentionally left semantics aside.

Before diving in, let us clarify our **notation and terminology**. We will use the symbol $I_0$ to denote the *primitive idea*, the sole atomic element we start with. (One might also call it $P$ for "Primitive", but we choose $I_0$ to signify "Idea at level 0".) In each version of the theory, new ideas are generated by certain operations applied to existing ideas. We will use $\delta$ as a generic notation for an abstraction operation (its arity and interpretation will vary by version). For example, in the unary setting, $\delta(X)$ will denote the abstraction of idea $X$ (a unary operation). In the binary setting, $\delta(X,Y)$ will denote the abstraction of $Y$ under $X$ (a binary operation). We stick with the symbol $\delta$ throughout for consistency, as a nod to the notion of a "difference" or "derivative" (since each abstraction can be seen as a step difference from the prior). The use of $\delta$ in phrases like "δ-based complexity" will refer to the fact that our complexity measure is derived from counting or encoding these $\delta$ operations.

We emphasize that **all results we prove are relative to the formal system itself**. For instance, when we prove uniqueness of abstraction chains, we mean in the formal sense (no two distinct formal derivations produce the same final idea structure). This is a mathematical combinatorial fact. We are not claiming anything directly about how humans think or how meaning works in natural language – though in the philosophical discussion we will cautiously draw analogies. The tone of our development will be formal and cautious: each claim will be stated as a definition, axiom, or theorem, and we will either prove it or explain it carefully along with any limitations. We remain aware that a formal theory of ideas, no matter how internally consistent, ultimately needs to interface with reality (cognitive or semantic) to be fully meaningful – but that is beyond our present scope. By deliberately isolating the structural aspect, we hope to provide a solid skeleton that future work can flesh out with semantics and empirical validation.

The structure of the paper follows the versions outlined: each of the next four sections (Sections 3–6) corresponds to Versions 1–4 of the theory, each building on the previous. Section 7 then delves into **Philosophical Meaning**, Section 8 discusses **Applications**, and Section 9 concludes.

## Version 1 – Primitive and Unary Abstraction

We begin with the most basic version of the theory. **Version 1** introduces the minimum ingredients: a single primitive idea and one abstraction operation that creates a new idea from an existing one. This corresponds to a simple *unary* generative process, akin to a successor function in arithmetic or an "idea of an idea" concept in naive terms. Despite its simplicity, we will formalize it carefully and establish the important property of *unique abstraction chains* in this setting, setting the stage for more complex versions.

### Definitions and Axioms (Version 1)

**Definition 1.1 (Ideas in Version 1):** There exists a unique *primitive idea*, denoted $I_0$. The set of all **ideas** in Version 1, denoted $\mathcal{I}_1$, is defined inductively as follows:

- (Base) $I_0 \in \mathcal{I}_1$.
- (Abstraction) If $X \in \mathcal{I}_1$, then $\delta(X) \in \mathcal{I}_1$.
- No other elements are in $\mathcal{I}_1$ except those obtained by a finite number of applications of the $\delta$ operation starting from $I_0$.

In plain language, $\mathcal{I}_1 = \{ I_0,\ \delta(I_0),\ \delta(\delta(I_0)),\ \delta(\delta(\delta(I_0))),\ \dots\}$ – an infinite sequence. We will sometimes denote $\delta^n(I_0)$ for the idea obtained by $n$ successive $\delta$ applications on $I_0$ (with $\delta^0(I_0) := I_0$ for convenience).

**Axiom 1.1 (Primitive Uniqueness):** The primitive idea $I_0$ has no internal structure and is unique. This means there is exactly one 0-ary idea (no multiple distinct primitives). This axiom is analogous to the uniqueness of the empty set in ZF set theory (extensionality implies there is only one empty set ([Set Theory | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/set-theo/#:~:text=match%20at%20L482%20The%20empty,denote%20the%20empty%20set))).

**Axiom 1.2 (Structural Identity – Unary):** Ideas are identical if and only if they have the same construction history from $I_0$. More formally, we assume $\delta$ is an *injective* operation on ideas. For any $X, Y \in \mathcal{I}_1$: if $\delta(X) = \delta(Y)$, then $X = Y$. Together with the understanding that $I_0$ is unique, this means each element of $\mathcal{I}_1$ has a *unique predecessor* (except $I_0$ which has none). There is no other identification or equivalence imposed on ideas. In particular, $\delta(X) \neq X$ for any $X$ (no idempotence), and we do not identify distinct $\delta$-iterations with each other.

*Axiom 1.2 is fundamental:* it captures the notion that we consider only the *structure* (here, the number of $\delta$ steps from the primitive) as determining identity. This is akin to a principle of extensionality in this context – the "element" of an idea is its predecessor in the abstraction chain. If two ideas have the same predecessor and were produced by the same abstraction operation, and the operation is injective, they must coincide. (This is trivially satisfied in this unary setting, but we state it explicitly as it will generalize.) Without this axiom, one could imagine a degenerate interpretation where $\delta(X)$ might sometimes equal $\delta(Y)$ even if $X \neq Y$, which would ruin uniqueness of representation. We disallow that by fiat.

We do not need many more axioms at this stage – essentially we are describing a free unary algebra on one generator. It is a **term algebra** with a single constant symbol $I_0$ and a single unary function symbol $\delta$. By standard results in universal algebra, this structure is an **initial algebra** in its category and all terms are unique up to identity ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=Freely%20generated%20algebraic%20structure%20over,a%20given%20signature)). We will prove the uniqueness of abstraction chains directly to be self-contained.

### Theorems and Properties (Version 1)

**Theorem 1.1 (Existence and Uniqueness of Abstraction Chains in $\mathcal{I}_1$):** Every idea $X \in \mathcal{I}_1$ is of the form $\delta^n(I_0)$ for a unique natural number $n \ge 0$. In other words:

1. (Existence) For each $X \in \mathcal{I}_1$, there exists some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $X = \delta^n(I_0)$.
2. (Uniqueness) If $\delta^m(I_0) = \delta^n(I_0)$, then $m = n$. Equivalently, each idea has a *unique* abstraction chain leading back to $I_0$.

*Proof:* Existence is by the inductive definition of $\mathcal{I}_1$: by definition, any $X \in \mathcal{I}_1$ is obtained by a finite number of $\delta$ applications on $I_0$. So certainly $X = \delta^n(I_0)$ for *some* $n$ (just take $n$ equal to that number of applications). Uniqueness is proven by induction on the length of the chain. 

- **Base ($n=0$):** The only idea obtained by zero $\delta$ applications is $I_0$ itself. So there is no ambiguity for $n=0$. 
- **Inductive Step:** Suppose for some $k < N$, it is already established that if $\delta^m(I_0) = \delta^n(I_0)$ with $m,n \le k$, then $m=n$. Now consider two representations of some idea as $\delta^N(I_0)$ and $\delta^M(I_0)$ with $M,N > 0$. We have $\delta^N(I_0) = \delta(\delta^{N-1}(I_0))$ and $\delta^M(I_0) = \delta(\delta^{M-1}(I_0))$. If these are equal, i.e. $\delta(\delta^{N-1}(I_0)) = \delta(\delta^{M-1}(I_0))$, then by Axiom 1.2 (injectivity of $\delta$) we must have $\delta^{N-1}(I_0) = \delta^{M-1}(I_0)$. Now $N-1$ and $M-1$ are at most $N-1 < N$ and $M-1 < M$, so at most $N-1$ (assuming WLOG $N \ge M$). By the inductive hypothesis, this implies $N-1 = M-1$. Thus $N = M$. This completes the induction, proving uniqueness for all $n$. □

This theorem shows that the ideas in $\mathcal{I}_1$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (including 0). In fact, we can define a simple complexity measure here: $\mathit{complexity}(I_0) := 0$, and $\mathit{complexity}(\delta(X)) := \mathit{complexity}(X) + 1$. By Theorem 1.1, $\mathit{complexity}(\delta^n(I_0)) = n$, and if $\mathit{complexity}(X) = \mathit{complexity}(Y)$ then $X = Y$ in this version (since that would imply they are $\delta^n(I_0)$ and $\delta^m(I_0)$ with the same $n=m$). So the complexity measure (which in this simple case is just the chain length) *uniquely determines the structure* of the idea. It’s a very trivial kind of δ-based complexity: essentially the count of δ-steps. We note this formally:

**Corollary 1.2 (δ-Complexity in Version 1):** Define $\delta\text{-}\mathit{len}(X)$ for $X\in\mathcal{I}_1$ as the unique $n$ such that $X = \delta^n(I_0)$. Then $\delta\text{-}\mathit{len}: \mathcal{I}_1 \to \mathbb{N}$ is a bijection. In particular, it is injective, so the value $\delta\text{-}\mathit{len}(X)$ uniquely identifies $X$. Thus the “δ-based complexity” (here just the length of the abstraction chain) uniquely determines the idea’s structure.

*Proof:* This is immediate from Theorem 1.1. $\delta\text{-}\mathit{len}$ is well-defined by existence and uniqueness of $n$. It is injective by uniqueness. It is also clearly surjective onto $\mathbb{N}$ because for every $n$ we have $\delta^n(I_0)$ in the codomain. □

In more narrative terms, in Version 1 the theory of ideas is essentially equivalent to the theory of natural number counting. We have a genesis story: $I_0$ is the first idea (think of it as "the primordial notion") and $\delta$ generates “the idea of that idea” (which is $\delta(I_0)$), and then $\delta(\delta(I_0))$ = “the idea of the idea of the idea”, and so on. Each idea is nothing but a stack of “idea-of” operators applied to the primitive. There is an obvious structural order here: we can say $\delta^m(I_0)$ is more *complex* than $\delta^n(I_0)$ if $m>n$, since it has more abstraction steps. And since the chain is unique, there’s no ambiguity in such comparisons.

**Limitation of Version 1:** This system, while clear, is not very powerful in expressive terms. All it can represent is a single infinite hierarchy of abstracted concepts, each one an “abstract generalization” of the previous in some unspecified way. If one tries to assign an intuitive meaning, perhaps $I_0$ could be some raw sense-datum, $\delta(I_0)$ an abstract concept from that, $\delta(\delta(I_0))$ an abstract concept from the previous abstract concept, etc. But without additional structure, these abstractions don’t branch or diversify; there's essentially only one line of thought. In formal terms, $\mathcal{I}_1$ is in bijection with $\mathbb{N}$, so it lacks the richness to encode varied content or multiple dimensions. 

Another limitation: there is no notion of combining two separate ideas into a new one. Each new idea comes from exactly one parent idea. If we thought of ideas as sets (just as an analogy), this is like a universe where every set has exactly one element (its predecessor), forming a simple chain $\{\{\{\cdots\{\varnothing\}\cdots\}\}\}$. Such a universe is a very degenerate case of set theory. Indeed, in set theory one typically can combine two sets $A$ and $B$ (e.g. form $\{A,B\}$); here we have nothing analogous.

However, **Version 1 establishes the pattern of reasoning** we will use: inductive construction and proving uniqueness by induction and injectivity of constructors. The simplicity of this version also highlights the role of *structural identity*. If we were to consider a scenario where $\delta(X) = \delta(Y)$ but $X \neq Y$, that would violate Axiom 1.2; we have forbidden that, as it would mean two different chains collapse into one idea. In Version 1, that kind of collapse can’t happen anyway unless the operation $\delta$ itself had some algebraic property (like idempotence $\delta(X)=X$ or periodicity $\delta^k(X)=X$ for some $k$) – but we assume it doesn’t.

Finally, we note that **semantic equivalence is completely trivial here** – since we have no semantics, we can’t even say something like "$\delta^2(I_0)$ has the same meaning as $\delta(I_0)$", because we have not assigned any meaning at all. All differences are structural. This means even if one had an urge to say "$\delta(\delta(I_0))$ might mean the same as $\delta(I_0)$ in some context", within the theory they are distinct (because one is two steps from $I_0$ and the other is one step). We enforce this strictly. In a sense, Version 1 is a formal system that doesn’t *need* semantics to be fully understood; it’s purely syntactical and combinatorial.

Having built this simplest model, we move on to **Version 2**, which enriches the abstraction process by introducing multiple modes of abstraction, addressing the first limitation (lack of branching diversity).

## Version 2 – Multi-Modal Unary Abstraction

Version 2 extends the unary abstraction framework by allowing **multiple abstraction operations (modes)** instead of just one. This means that from any given idea, there may be more than one way to abstract a new idea from it, each way labeled or distinguished by a mode. For example, one might have a mode $A$ and a mode $B$ such that from idea $X$ one can get $\delta_A(X)$ or $\delta_B(X)$, which are considered different ideas. This adds a branching factor to the idea-generation process: the structure of an idea is no longer just how many abstraction steps, but also *which sequence of modes* were chosen at each step.

This version is motivated by the observation that in human thought or in classification systems, we often have different "kinds" of abstraction or different aspects under which one can abstract from a concept. For instance, given a concrete concept like "a red apple," one might abstract to "fruit" (abstracting color away) or to "red thing" (abstracting shape/type away), etc. Those are different modes of abstraction yielding different results. In our formal setting, we won't attach meanings like color or shape – we simply allow the formal possibility of different abstraction modalities.

### Definitions and Axioms (Version 2)

**Definition 2.1 (Modes and Ideas in Version 2):** Let $M$ be a non-empty index set of *modes*. (This could be finite or infinite; for generality we can take $M$ countably infinite or even uncountable, but it won't matter – even two modes would illustrate the concept.) For each mode $m \in M$, we have a unary abstraction operation $\delta_m(\cdot)$. The set of all ideas in Version 2, $\mathcal{I}_2$, is defined inductively by:

- $I_0 \in \mathcal{I}_2$ (the same unique primitive as before).
- If $X \in \mathcal{I}_2$ and $m \in M$, then $\delta_m(X) \in \mathcal{I}_2$.
- No other elements are in $\mathcal{I}_2$.

Thus, every idea in $\mathcal{I}_2$ can be seen as a finite *word* of mode symbols from $M$ applied to $I_0$. For example, $\delta_{a}(I_0)$ (using a generic $a\in M$) is a first-level abstract idea of type $a$, $\delta_b(\delta_a(I_0))$ would be an idea obtained by first abstracting in mode $a$, then from that result abstracting in mode $b$, denoted $\delta_b(\delta_a(I_0))$ (or succinctly $\delta_b\delta_a(I_0)$). In general, an element of $\mathcal{I}_2$ is of the form $\delta_{m_n}\delta_{m_{n-1}}\cdots\delta_{m_1}(I_0)$ for some finite sequence $m_1, m_2, ..., m_n$ of modes from $M$. We will also write this as $\delta_{m_n}(\delta_{m_{n-1}}(\cdots \delta_{m_1}(I_0)\cdots))$, or abbreviate it by a string of mode labels $m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n$ applied to $I_0$. For instance, if $M = \{A,B\}$, one idea could be $ABA(I_0)$ as a shorthand for $\delta_A(\delta_B(\delta_A(I_0)))$.

**Axiom 2.1 (Structural Identity – Multi-Modal):** The structural identity criterion now entails that **each mode of abstraction is injective and distinct**. Formally, for any modes $m, m' \in M$ and any ideas $X, Y \in \mathcal{I}_2$: if $\delta_m(X) = \delta_{m'}(Y)$, then *both* $m = m'$ and $X = Y$. In other words, two results of abstraction are equal only if they were obtained by the same mode from equal source ideas. This implies in particular that for a given mode $m$, $\delta_m$ is injective (no two different $X,Y$ yield the same $\delta_m(X) = \delta_m(Y)$), and that different modes never coincide on outputs (if $m \neq m'$, $\delta_m(X)$ can never equal $\delta_{m'}(Y)$, no matter what $X,Y$ are).

Axiom 2.1 generalizes Axiom 1.2. We still have one primitive $I_0$ that is unique. Now we have multiple $\delta$ operations, but we require that the structure (the exact sequence of operations) is recoverable from the final product. This is essentially saying the algebra of ideas is a **free term algebra over the signature** consisting of one constant $I_0$ and unary function symbols $\{\delta_m : m \in M\}$. Such a term algebra is known to have unique readability: each term (idea) can be uniquely parsed into its construction steps ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=Freely%20generated%20algebraic%20structure%20over,a%20given%20signature)). Axiom 2.1 is the no-identification condition that ensures we indeed have the free algebra, not some quotient where different sequences yield the same result.

We carry over **Axiom 1.1 (Primitive Uniqueness)** unchanged: there is still exactly one primitive idea $I_0$. 

Intuitively, the axioms mean that the **path matters**. For example, $\delta_A(I_0)$ and $\delta_B(I_0)$ are distinct by virtue of $A\neq B$. Also, if $\delta_A(I_0) = \delta_A(\delta_B(I_0))$, then by injectivity we would deduce $I_0 = \delta_B(I_0)$, which cannot be (since $I_0$ is primitive and $\delta_B(I_0)$ is a “child” of it, not equal unless some identification is forced). We have no such identifications, so indeed all these objects remain distinct.

### Theorems and Properties (Version 2)

**Theorem 2.1 (Unique Abstraction Chains in $\mathcal{I}_2$):** Every idea $X \in \mathcal{I}_2$ can be written uniquely as $\delta_{m_n}\delta_{m_{n-1}}\cdots\delta_{m_1}(I_0)$ for some finite sequence of modes $m_1, ..., m_n \in M$. In particular, the sequence (or “chain”) of modes leading from $I_0$ to $X$ is unique.

*Proof (Sketch):* This is a straightforward generalization of the proof of Theorem 1.1, now using induction on the length of the mode sequence. We simultaneously argue existence and uniqueness:

- *Existence:* By definition, any $X \in \mathcal{I}_2$ is obtained by some finite number of mode applications on $I_0$. So $X = \delta_{m_n}(...\delta_{m_1}(I_0)...)$ for some sequence $m_1,...,m_n$. That's by construction.

- *Uniqueness:* Suppose $X$ can be represented by two mode sequences: $X = \delta_{m_k}\cdots\delta_{m_1}(I_0) = \delta_{m'_{l}}\cdots\delta_{m'_1}(I_0)$. We need to show these sequences are identical term-by-term. We do induction on the length of the sequences. If one sequence has length 0, then $X=I_0$; the other must also yield $I_0$. The only sequence that yields $I_0$ is the empty sequence (since applying any $\delta$ produces a non-primitive idea). So if one representation has $n=0$, the other must too; trivial case. Now assume both representations have length $\ge 1$. Then $X = \delta_{m_n}(Y)$ for $Y = \delta_{m_{n-1}}\cdots\delta_{m_1}(I_0)$, and also $X = \delta_{m'_l}(Y')$ for some $Y'$ from the other sequence. Now $\delta_{m_n}(Y) = \delta_{m'_l}(Y')$. By Axiom 2.1, we deduce that $m_n = m'_l$ (the last modes must match) and $Y = Y'$. So in fact both sequences end in the same mode and produce the same predecessor idea $Y = Y'$. Now we can cancel that last step and conclude $Y$ has two representations by shorter sequences (of length $n-1$ and $l-1$ respectively). By the inductive hypothesis on smaller length, those two sequences for $Y$ must be identical. Appending the same final mode $m_n=m'_l$ to them, we conclude the full sequences for $X$ are identical. □

This theorem confirms that $\mathcal{I}_2$ has a one-to-one correspondence with sequences (words) over the alphabet $M$. If we think of $M$ as an alphabet, each idea is like a unique “string” of mode symbols, reading from the primitive outward. In computer science terms, $\mathcal{I}_2$ is the set of all ground terms over a signature of unary function symbols $M$ and constant $I_0$. Such terms indeed have a unique parse (chain) by construction.

Given this correspondence, we can define a **complexity measure** in many ways. One natural measure is again the length of the sequence (the number of abstraction steps). Another could incorporate the alphabet symbols to ensure uniqueness (though length alone won’t uniquely identify the idea, it’s a part of the story). A more precise complexity measure could encode the entire sequence as a number. For instance, we could fix an encoding of each mode $m \in M$ as an integer or bit string, and then encode a sequence $m_1...m_n$ as a single integer via a combinatorial encoding (like interleaving bits or using a prime factorization trick). One straightforward method for an injective encoding is to use a pairing function iteratively: for example, assign each mode $m$ a unique positive integer code $\#(m)$. Then we can define a Gödel-style encoding $\mathit{Code}(I_0) = 1$ (or 0) and $\mathit{Code}(\delta_m(X)) = 2^{\#(m)} \cdot \mathit{Code}(X)$. If we choose all mode codes $\#(m)$ distinct, this multiplication by a distinct power of 2 each time yields a unique number (leveraging the uniqueness of prime factorizations: the exponents of 2 in the final number will record the multiset of modes used). A simpler approach: treat the pair $(\#(m), n)$ as one step and encode by Cantor pairing or something. But we need not get bogged down: the **existence** of some injective complexity measure is guaranteed by the fact that the set of finite sequences over $M$ is countable (if $M$ is countable) or at least well-orderable if $M$ is well-orderable, etc. We can always assign a unique ordinal or natural number to each sequence.

**Corollary 2.2 (Complexity Measure in Version 2):** There exists a function $\kappa: \mathcal{I}_2 \to \mathbb{N}$ (assuming $M$ is countable; or to ordinals if uncountable) such that $\kappa$ is injective. One simple choice is $\kappa(\delta_{m_n}\cdots\delta_{m_1}(I_0)) =$ the natural number whose base-$|M|$ representation is the concatenation of the code digits for $m_1,...,m_n$. In any case, one can assign each idea a unique **δ-code** or **δ-complexity index**. Thus, $\kappa(X) = \kappa(Y)$ if and only if $X=Y$ in $\mathcal{I}_2$. In particular, if we just take the length and the sequence itself, that pair uniquely determines the structure.

*Proof Sketch:* Using Theorem 2.1, $X$ and $Y$ have unique mode sequences. If those sequences are different, one can always find a way to map sequences to numbers injectively (for example, fix a bijection $f: M \to \{1,...,|M|\}$ if $M$ is finite, or to $\mathbb{N}$ if $M$ is countable; then define $\kappa(I_0)=0$, and for a sequence $m_1...m_n$ define $\kappa(\delta_{m_n}...\delta_{m_1}(I_0))$ as $\sum_{i=1}^n f(m_i) \cdot (|M|)^{i-1}$ if $M$ is finite – this is basically treating the mode sequence as a base-$|M|$ number with digits $f(m_i)$). This is clearly injective: different sequences give different sums because they differ in some digit place. If $M$ is infinite countable, one can do a similar trick by encoding mode labels with distinct prime powers or using Cantor pairing repeatedly. The key point is that since the representation of each idea is unique, encoding that representation yields a unique code. So $\kappa$ exists and is injective. □

This corollary formalizes the idea that **δ-based complexity uniquely determines structure** in Version 2. However, note that unlike Version 1, here "complexity" cannot be a single natural number like the length alone – length alone is not injective (many different ideas have the same number of steps). We need the whole sequence or an encoding of it. Usually by "complexity" one might expect a numeric measure like length or something akin to Kolmogorov complexity. In our context, $\kappa(X)$ is more like a *description* (the actual code of the construction) rather than a simple scalar measure. One could of course consider the pair (length, lexicographic rank) as the complexity. 

If we analogize to **Kolmogorov complexity**, there is a similarity: Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the length of the shortest program generating it ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)). Here, because each idea *is* generated by one particular "program" (the sequence of modes) which is in fact the shortest and only program to generate it, the length of that program and the program itself serve as a description of the idea. In a sense, every idea in $\mathcal{I}_2$ has a *unique minimal description* in terms of the primitive and abstraction steps, reminiscent of an idea that “the shortest description of an object is unique if we fix a descriptive language” ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)). Our descriptive language is the mode sequence, and given our axioms, no object has two different descriptions, so the shortest description is also the only description. (This is a bit idealized compared to true Kolmogorov complexity where multiple programs could produce the same output string but we look for the shortest; here, multiple programs producing the same output is disallowed by design.)

**Discussion:** Version 2 yields a **tree** of ideas branching from $I_0$. If $M$ has $k$ elements, the branching factor is up to $k$ at each node (like a $k$-ary tree, though $k$ unary operations is effectively the same as $k$-ary branching in the tree of generation). If $M$ is infinite, it’s like a tree with possibly infinitely many children at each node. Regardless, it’s a hierarchy reminiscent of a **type hierarchy or ontology** (though extremely generic). We can think of $I_0$ as the most concrete or base concept, and each mode $m$ as an aspect in which we can generalize or abstract. For instance, if we were to give a toy semantics: imagine $I_0$ = “a specific object”. $\delta_{\text{Color}}(I_0)$ might mean "the color of that object" (abstracting away everything but color), while $\delta_{\text{Shape}}(I_0)$ means "the shape of that object". Then $\delta_{\text{Generic}}(\delta_{\text{Color}}(I_0))$ might further abstract color to just "being colored" or something. This is a purely illustrative semantic overlay – formally we do not ascribe such interpretations, but it's useful to see how modes could correspond to conceptual operations like projection or generalization of certain attributes.

In this formal version, still **no two different ideas coincide**, so nonsense is still not particularly evident because with multiple modes we don’t yet have an obvious notion of a contradictory or meaningless combination – except one could say an idea like $\delta_{\text{Color}}(\delta_{\text{Shape}}(I_0))$ might be "the color of the shape of object" which, if you try to interpret, could be nonsensical (color of a shape?). But formally it’s perfectly fine: it's just $\delta_{\text{Color}}(\delta_{\text{Shape}}(I_0))$, a distinct node in the tree. Our system *allows it* even if interpretatively one might scratch their head. This highlights the point: **conceptual nonsense is formally allowed**. If the modes were intended to have some real-world meaning, not every composition of them may make sense in reality; however, we do not prevent the formal combination. This can be justified in a similar vein as in mathematics we allow algebraic expressions that might not make semantic sense under certain interpretations until evaluated or restricted (like you can write $\sqrt{-1}$ even if you're initially working over reals, it just means something outside the reals until you extend the number system). Our formalism doesn’t complain about $\delta_{\text{Color}}(\delta_{\text{Shape}}(I_0))$; it is a valid idea. It would be up to a semantic theory later to say maybe that idea has no interpretation (or find one, e.g., maybe the shape has a color if we imagine shape embodied in an object – one can contrive something, but anyway).

**Limitation of Version 2:** The major limitation remaining is that ideas cannot be combined *horizontally*. We only have the vertical tree-growing via unary abstraction. Suppose we have two different ideas $X$ and $Y$ that both descended from $I_0$ (so they share the ultimate ancestor but are distinct branches). There is no operation in Version 2 that takes $X$ and $Y$ together to form a new idea. Each new idea always has exactly one parent. In terms of expressiveness, this means we cannot capture something like a *combination* of two concepts or a relation between two ideas as a new idea. For example, if one mode gives "fruit" and another branch gives "red", we cannot directly form an idea corresponding to "red fruit" by combining the idea "fruit" and the idea "red". In Version 2, "red fruit" would have to appear as a result of some unary abstraction from either "fruit" or "red" or $I_0$, which doesn't reflect combining independent concepts – it would enshrine one as prior and then abstract the other from it. But conceptually "red fruit" is more like combining the property "red" with the category "fruit". 

This signals that to talk about combining separate idea structures, we need a binary (or at least multi-ary) operation. That leads us to **Version 3**, where we introduce a binary abstraction allowing one idea to function as a modifier or operator on another.

Before proceeding, let’s highlight: **Set theory, type theory, and category theory parallels (for Version 2).** In set theory, by this stage (analogy) we have something like a von Neumann hierarchy if each $\delta_m$ were like some operation of adding a set marker. But not exactly, set theory would allow union of two sets, which we can't do yet. In type theory, Version 2 is reminiscent of a simple type system where $I_0$ is a ground type and we have unary type constructors (like list of X, option of X, etc.) – each mode is like a type constructor giving a new type from an old type. Our theorem of unique representation is akin to the principle that types have unique construction trees (which holds in well-formed type expressions without equivalences). Indeed, $\delta_m$ being distinct corresponds to type constructors being distinct, and injectivity corresponds to no different subtypes collapse – a property known in some formalizations as no "junk" or no "confusion" in algebraic specifications ([[PDF] DATA TYPES AS TERM ALGEBRAS - UBC Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/tr/1983/TR-83-02.pdf#:~:text=,of%20the%20intended%20set)). In category theory, one might see $\mathcal{I}_2$ as the free term algebra, which is the *initial object* in the category of all $M$-unary algebras. The unique chain property corresponds to initiality: any morphism out of the initial algebra is defined by its action on the generator and extends uniquely ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=signature%2C%20and%20this%20object%2C%20unique,5)). While we won't deep dive into category theory here, it’s worth noting the structural similarity: we have essentially defined an **initial term model** for a given signature, a concept well-known in categorical algebra and universal algebra.

Now, we turn to the next advancement: introducing a binary abstraction operation to allow idea combinations.

## Version 3 – Functional Binary Abstraction

Version 3 introduces the possibility of combining two ideas to produce a new idea. We call it **functional binary abstraction** because we conceptualize one idea as playing the role of a function (or operator) and the other as its argument or operand. This is akin to application in lambda calculus or function application in general: if $F$ and $X$ are ideas, we allow an idea that represents "$F$ abstracted over $X$". We will denote this by $\delta(F, X)$, using the same letter $\delta$ now as a binary operation. 

It is important to clarify that in this version we are not simply adding a binary operation *alongside* the unary ones of Version 2; rather, we are **supplanting or generalizing** the abstraction concept to binary form. In practice, we can incorporate both unary and binary (the unary being a special case when one argument is a fixed distinguished idea or something). But to keep the presentation streamlined, we will treat the binary abstraction as the primary operation. One can simulate the earlier unary modes by particular choices of one of the arguments. For example, a mode $m$ from Version 2 can be represented by an idea $F_m$ such that applying $F_m$ to an input $X$ via $\delta(F_m, X)$ yields the effect of $\delta_m(X)$. That is, in a sense, the unary operator $\delta_m$ is now *encoded as* a certain idea $F_m$ which is used in a binary application. This approach is analogous to how in combinatory logic or lambda calculus, you might have a constant function (like a combinator) that when applied yields a specific transformation of the argument.

**Goals for Version 3:** 
- Allow any idea to be used as a function on any other idea.
- Maintain uniqueness of representation.
- Define complexity measure accordingly.
- See the explosion of possible structures (graphs that are not simple tree chains but trees with binary nodes).
- Recognize that now truly "nonsensical" combinations can occur freely (since any $F$ can apply to any $X$, even if $F$ wasn't intended to be a function of an $X$).
- Connect this with concept of *self-application* (when $F = X$ in $\delta(F,X)$, i.e. an idea applied to itself, a form of self-reference).

### Definitions and Axioms (Version 3)

**Definition 3.1 (Ideas in Version 3):** The set of ideas $\mathcal{I}_3$ is generated as follows:

- $I_0 \in \mathcal{I}_3$ (the same unique primitive).
- If $F \in \mathcal{I}_3$ and $X \in \mathcal{I}_3$, then $\delta(F, X) \in \mathcal{I}_3$.
- No other elements are in $\mathcal{I}_3$.

Here $\delta(F, X)$ is a *binary* operation. We will often refer to $\delta(F,X)$ as "applying $F$ to $X$" or "the abstraction of $X$ by $F$". We might sometimes use notation like $F \circ X$ or $F(X)$ for brevity in discussions, but formally we keep $\delta(F,X)$.

This definition means that every idea in $\mathcal{I}_3$ is either the primitive $I_0$ or a binary tree whose nodes are labeled with $\delta$ and whose leaves are $I_0$. More concretely, each non-primitive idea has a form $\delta(A,B)$ where $A, B \in \mathcal{I}_3$ are "smaller" ideas (closer to $I_0$ presumably). This is the hallmark of an **algebra of terms with one binary operation**. It is the term algebra for a signature with one 2-ary function symbol $\delta$ and one constant $I_0$. 

**Axiom 3.1 (Structural Identity – Binary):** The pair $(F,X)$ is recoverable from $\delta(F,X)$. Formally, $\delta$ is an injective function of two arguments. If $\delta(F,X) = \delta(F', X')$, then $F = F'$ and $X = X'$. This ensures no two distinct pairs of ideas yield the same combined idea. Equivalently, $\delta$ as a constructor has the property of unique decomposition: an idea of the form $\delta(Y,Z)$ cannot equal an idea of the form $\delta(Y',Z')$ unless $Y=Y'$ and $Z=Z'$.

Axiom 3.1 is again a no-identification (or "no confusion" ([[PDF] DATA TYPES AS TERM ALGEBRAS - UBC Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/tr/1983/TR-83-02.pdf#:~:text=,of%20the%20intended%20set))) axiom, analogous to extensionality in set pairs (which implies if $\{a,b\}=\{c,d\}$ then presumably $a=c, b=d$ up to order, though here order matters). We do not impose any commutativity or symmetry on $\delta$; $(F,X)$ is an *ordered pair*. So $\delta(F,X) \neq \delta(X,F)$ in general unless $F=X$ (we do not identify those structures).

We also carry over the extensional uniqueness of the primitive $I_0$. So implicitly:
- $I_0$ is distinct from any $\delta(F,X)$ (since $\delta$ always yields something "built" not primitive).
- There is only one primitive (so you can't have two distinct things that behave as primitives; trivial here).

**Remark on encoding Version 2 in Version 3:** If we want to represent a unary mode $m$ from before, we can introduce an idea $F_m = \delta(I_0, X_m)$ for some *particular $X_m$*. Actually, since $I_0$ is the only constant, $F_m$ itself must ultimately be built from $I_0$. Perhaps a simpler scheme: designate that an application of the form $\delta(F_m, X)$ corresponds to the unary abstraction $\delta_m(X)$. To enforce that $F_m$ behaves distinctly for each $m$, $F_m$ could be a structure that “carries” the identity of $m$ in it. For example, if we had retained modes, we could artificially enforce structure. But systematically, one could fix some scheme like: define a "mode idea" $M$ as $\delta(I_0,I_0)$ (some canonical structure), then define $F_m$ as $\delta(M^m, I_0)$ i.e. apply $M$ to itself $m$ times in some encoding (if $m$ is like a number or index). The details aren't too important; the takeaway is that Version 3 is at least as expressive as Version 2 in principle because we can encode any unary abstraction as using a particular functional idea applied to the input. Version 3 actually vastly exceeds Version 2 in expressive power because now *any* idea can serve as an abstraction operator, not just some designated ones. 

### Theorems and Properties (Version 3)

**Theorem 3.1 (Unique Construction Tree in $\mathcal{I}_3$):** Every idea $X \in \mathcal{I}_3$ can be uniquely represented as a binary tree with leaves $I_0$. Formally, if we regard $\mathcal{I}_3$ as the set of ground terms over the signature $\{\delta(\cdot,\cdot), I_0\}$, then each $X$ is such a term. If $X$ can be written as $\delta(A,B)$ and also as $\delta(A',B')$ (possibly in multiple ways by different parenthesizations), the result of Axiom 3.1 is that the top-level decomposition is unique: $A=A'$ and $B=B'$. By applying this property recursively down the tree, it follows that the entire tree representation of $X$ is unique. Equivalently, the set $\mathcal{I}_3$ is the *free algebra* generated by $I_0$ with one binary operation, so the usual unique parse/unique decomposition property holds.

*Proof Sketch:* The formal proof is by induction on the size of the term (like term rewriting or structural induction arguments). A more direct reasoning: $\mathcal{I}_3$ as defined is *exactly* the term algebra (or term model) of the algebraic specification with one constant and one binary operator. It is well-known that term algebras have unique readability: no term can be read (parsed) in two different ways. Specifically, if $X$ is not $I_0$, then by the definition it *must* be of the form $\delta(F,X)$. There is no other way to form a non-primitive idea. So the *only* possible top-level parse of $X$ is as $\delta(\cdot,\cdot)$. Now if $X = \delta(P,Q)$ for some $P,Q$, that representation is unique by Axiom 3.1: there is no other pair $P',Q'$ with $\delta(P',Q')=X$. So the root separation is unique. Then apply the same argument to $P$ and $Q$ themselves: by induction, their sub-structure is uniquely determined. Ultimately you bottom out at $I_0$ leaves which are obviously uniform. Thus, each $X$ corresponds to exactly one binary-tree structure. □

This theorem is analogous to Theorem 2.1 but now for binary trees instead of sequences. It assures us that we haven't inadvertently introduced some algebraic identification (like $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0),I_0)$ equaling $\delta(I_0,\delta(I_0,I_0))$ or something weird — no, they are distinct since one is $\delta(A,I_0)$ and the other is $\delta(I_0,B)$ with $A=\delta(I_0,I_0)$ and $B=\delta(I_0,I_0)$, and Axiom 3.1 says those aren't equal unless $A=I_0$ and $B=I_0$, which they are not in that example). 

So $\mathcal{I}_3$ is isomorphic to the set of all finite full binary trees (each internal node with two children) whose leaf nodes are all labeled with $I_0$. Another way to see it: any $X\in\mathcal{I}_3$ can be written as $\delta^{n}(I_0)$ but in a two-dimensional notation – that notation doesn't linearize well because the order of δ applications can differ (non-associative). But we can linearize by some bracketed notation: e.g., $X = (((I_0 * I_0) * I_0) * (I_0 * I_0))$ as a representation (here using * for $\delta$) – that fully parenthesized expression is unique for $X$. This is essentially the parse tree.

Given this uniqueness, we can once again assert the existence of a **δ-based complexity measure**. However, now the measure needs to encode a binary tree structure, not just a linear string or length. There are known methods: one could do a Cantor pairing or Gödel encoding of a pair. For example, we can define $\mathit{Code}(I_0) = 0$. For a general idea $X = \delta(F,X)$, one can define $\mathit{Code}(X) = 2^{\mathit{Code}(F)} \cdot 3^{\mathit{Code}(X)}$ (use two distinct primes 2 and 3 to encode the pair) or any injective pairing function $N \times N \to N$. This will be injective because the prime power factorization is unique – the exponents (which are Code(F) and Code(X)) can be recovered uniquely ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=signature%2C%20and%20this%20object%2C%20unique,5)). Another scheme: treat the tree as a bitstring using a traversal encoding (e.g. encode it in parentheses: maybe "(()())" style, then map that to a binary sequence 1/0, then to an integer). The details are not particularly important to derive here, but we can assert:

**Corollary 3.2 (Injective Complexity Coding in Version 3):** There exists an injective function $\kappa: \mathcal{I}_3 \to \mathbb{N}$ that assigns each idea a unique code. For instance, define 
$$
\kappa(I_0) = 1, \qquad 
\kappa(\delta(F,X)) = \mathrm{pair}(\kappa(F),\, \kappa(X)) ,
$$ 
where $\mathrm{pair}(a,b)$ is a fixed pairing function (like $\mathrm{pair}(a,b) = 2^a \cdot (2b+1)$ or Cantor's pairing $(1/2)(a+b)(a+b+1)+b$). By the property of pairing functions, $\kappa$ is one-to-one ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=,T%7D%7D%28X%29%7D%20to%20its%20corresponding)). Thus, a δ-based complexity measure (the code $\kappa(X)$) uniquely determines $X$'s entire structure.

The proof is basically constructing $\kappa$ using the uniqueness of tree representation. Since each idea's structure is unique, we just encode that structure. We cited one possible pairing approach: using distinct prime bases (2 and 3) is particularly straightforward and leverages unique prime factorization ([
Non-wellfounded Set Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonwellfounded-set-theory/#:~:text=The%20term%20non,Foundation%20Axiom)). For example, $\kappa(\delta(F,X)) = 2^{\kappa(F)} 3^{\kappa(X)}$. No two distinct pairs $(F,X)$ will yield the same $2^a 3^b$ because if $2^{a}3^{b}=2^{a'}3^{b'}$, equating prime exponents gives $a=a'$ and $b=b'$. Thus it's injective.

So again, *complexity uniquely determines structure*. However, now the "complexity" can no longer be summarized as a single simple number like "the number of abstraction steps" – because even the number of steps (number of internal nodes) is not enough. For example, $\delta(I_0,\delta(I_0,I_0))$ and $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), I_0)$ both have 2 abstraction nodes (so length 2), but they are different structures. Our complexity measure might give those two distinct codes (e.g. one might code to $2^1 3^{2^1 3^1}$ vs the other $2^{2^1 3^1}3^1$, which are different numbers indeed). 

It might be that by "δ-based complexity" the intention was some measure of how "complex" an idea is in terms of generative steps. Perhaps the number of nodes or height could be considered complexity metrics too:
- The **depth** (max chain length from root to leaf) of the idea's tree might measure one kind of complexity (like how abstract it got in one branch).
- The **size** (total number of $I_0$ occurrences or $\delta$ nodes) is another measure (like how large the structure is).
- The theorem actually gives a stronger statement: not only length or depth, but the entire structure is encoded.

However, the phrasing "*δ-based complexity uniquely determines structure*" suggests maybe that the complexity measure we use is inherently tied to δ (the operations count). It's safe to interpret that as we did: we count or encode δ operations in such a way that the code is unique.

Now, with Version 3, we have a qualitatively new phenomenon: **functional abstraction and conceptual nonsense**. Since any idea can appear in the function position, we can have situations like:
- $\delta(X,Y)$ where $X$ was not "meant" to be a function of $Y$ in some semantic sense. For example, let $X = \delta(I_0,I_0)$ (this is an idea that might stand for something like "some composite concept") and $Y = I_0$ (the primitive). $\delta(X,Y) = \delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), I_0)$. If we foolishly try to interpret $X$ as (say) the concept of "apple" and $Y$ as "tomato", then $\delta(X,Y)$ might correspond to something like "apple tomato"? which is nonsense. Or if $X$ was "red" and $Y$ was "fruit", $\delta(X,Y)$ could be imagined as "red applied to fruit" = "red fruit" which *is* a meaningful concept "red fruit." So some applications will have intuitive meaning (if one argument is something like an adjective concept and the other a noun concept, one can read an interpretation in natural language), but others will not (if both arguments are nouns, "apple tomato" doesn't directly mean anything, though maybe a tomato that is an apple? It's odd). The formal system does not differentiate – any $X$ can apply to any $Y$. 

This is akin to an **untyped lambda calculus** or **combinatory logic** in spirit: those systems allow any term to be applied to any other term (some combinations may lead to irreducible terms that don't reduce to meaningful normal forms, but the system itself is fine with that). By contrast, in a strongly typed system (like a typed lambda calculus or categorical combinators), you would restrict which applications are allowed (ensuring, e.g., that $X$ is a function that expects input of the type of $Y$). Our approach is deliberately untyped, meaning we allow "type errors" as legitimate terms. In programming language lingo, our system will happily consider the term *1 + "hi"* as a valid term structure (if we had a way to represent numbers and strings), whereas a type checker would reject it as nonsense ([Principles of Dependent Type Theory](https://carloangiuli.com/courses/b619-sp24/notes.pdf#:~:text=type%02checker%20may%20reject%20as%20nonsense,scoped)). Indeed, recall the type theory reference: a typechecker rejects `1 + "hi"` as nonsense because no successful evaluation is possible ([Principles of Dependent Type Theory](https://carloangiuli.com/courses/b619-sp24/notes.pdf#:~:text=type%02checker%20may%20reject%20as%20nonsense,scoped)). Similarly, in our theory, there's nothing preventing an "addition" idea to apply to a "word" idea, producing a new idea that might not correspond to any real concept. We *embrace* that scenario in formal terms; we just call it another idea. 

The justification for allowing this "conceptual nonsense" formally is that we want the formal system to be **maximally inclusive** so that it doesn't bias or restrict what counts as an idea. If later some ideas turn out semantically void or contradictory, that would be addressed by interpretation or additional semantic constraints, not by the core formal generation rules. This is similar to how set theory will form sets that might have no finite or concrete interpretation, or how category theory says there could be a morphism between any objects even if you didn't intend one (unless restricted by a specific category). Another viewpoint is **paraconsistent logic** or naive frameworks: sometimes it's fruitful to include contradictions/nonsense and then manage them, rather than exclude them upfront. 

Now, because Version 3 introduces the possibility of *self-application* as well (take $F = X$ in $\delta(F,X)$, i.e. $\delta(X,X)$), we can formalize something akin to self-referential ideas. For example, let's call $S = \delta(I_0,I_0)$. Then consider $\delta(S,S) = \delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), \delta(I_0,I_0))$. This $Z = \delta(S,S)$ is an idea which is structurally a binary tree where both left and right subtrees are identical (each is $S$). According to our rules it's perfectly fine. If one tried to interpret $S$ as some concept $C$, then $Z$ would be "$C$ applied to $C$". If $C$ means an operation, that's a self-application. If $C$ is a statement, it's a self-referential statement in a way. The structure allows it. There is no paradox in just having the structure; paradoxes come if we assign it a truth value or a set membership meaning perhaps. But formally, $\delta(S,S)$ poses no problem. It's a fixed point of sorts: $Z$ contains a copy of itself? Actually, $Z$ contains $S$ which contains $I_0$ twice, not exactly itself. If we tried to solve $Z = \delta(Z, X)$ for some $X$, that would be self-containing in a different way (like $Z$ appears as a subterm of itself). That might require infinite regress, which our definition disallowed by requiring finite generation steps (no infinite descending chain allowed in well-founded term algebra).

We might note: we did implicitly assume *foundation* (no infinite descending chain of abstractions, or no infinitely nested $\delta$ without reaching $I_0$). In a formal sense, $\mathcal{I}_3$ as we defined are finite terms. We did not include the possibility of an infinitely deep tree (which would be like a limit object). If we allowed that, we could represent perhaps a self-referential infinite idea like a solution to $X = \delta(X,X)$. But we didn't; all ideas are finite by inductive definition. So something like $X = \delta(X,X)$ has no solution in $\mathcal{I}_3$ (except trivial infinite one if we extended to some completed domain). So, we *avoid actual paradoxes* by construction (foundation in set terms), but we allow wide-ranging finite combos.

**Comparison to Set Theory:** At this stage, there's an interesting parallel: in ZF set theory, to avoid paradoxes like Russell's, one employs the Foundation (Regularity) axiom that no set is an element of itself or of an infinite regress ([
Non-wellfounded Set Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonwellfounded-set-theory/#:~:text=The%20term%20non,Foundation%20Axiom)). Our construction similarly avoids $\delta$-cycles by building only well-founded trees. We might reflect: if we removed that well-foundedness and allowed solutions to recursive definitions, we'd get something akin to non-well-founded sets (Aczel's AFA) where $X = \{X\}$ has a unique solution in that theory ([
Non-wellfounded Set Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonwellfounded-set-theory/#:~:text=The%20term%20non,Foundation%20Axiom)). Similarly, $\delta(X,X)$ could equal $X$ in a non-well-founded extension. That would be truly self-referential (like a loop). We do not go that far here (though one could conceive a Version 3* that allows cyclical definitions, which would complicate uniqueness since a finite graph with a cycle can't be unfolded uniquely into a tree unless you allow infinite unfolding).

**Limitation of Version 3:** The system now can combine any two ideas, which is very powerful, but still something is "missing" from an interpretive standpoint: we have not attached *any semantics or meaning to the structure beyond structure itself*. The formal system blindly generates combinations. One could ask: can we distinguish within the system those combinations that appear "meaningful" from those that don't? At this stage, *no*, because the system doesn’t know about meaning. However, one might try to impose some *patterns* as having special significance. For example, maybe an idea of the form $\delta(F,I_0)$ we interpret as something like applying $F$ to the base object (like a unary mode represented by $F$). Or a pattern like $\delta(I_0,X)$ could be interpreted as something (like maybe $I_0$ as a function could mean an identity operation or a marker meaning "such that"? Hard to say). 

This leads to the thinking: perhaps we want to *recover some semantics externally* by looking at structural patterns. This motivates Version 4, where we drastically minimize the system to a single binary constructor and one primitive, and consider how semantics might arise from recognizing recurring patterns in these binary trees. We effectively already have that scenario in Version 3 (since we have one constructor anyway; we just also had implicitly an infinite class of objects to use as possible functions). In Version 4, we won't add new operations, we will just emphasize patterns and minimality, possibly eliminating even the distinction of a separate primitive constant beyond $I_0$.

One more observation on Version 3: In terms of known theories:
- It resembles an **applicative term system** (like combinator trees). Actually, $\mathcal{I}_3$ is isomorphic to the set of all S-expressions in Lisp with one distinguished atomic symbol. In Lisp terms, if we only have one atom `I0` and one binary operation (which you could consider as making a cons cell or application), then every S-expression is a binary tree with `I0` at leaves. This is basically the idea of a **universal data structure** (like Lisp cons) that can represent arbitrarily complex structures. We know Lisp can represent any data with cons and atoms, and even any program. In fact, Church encoding or combinator encoding can represent lambda calculus in such a term algebra. We have essentially reached a similarly universal representational capability: *any possible finite discrete structure can be encoded as an idea in $\mathcal{I}_3$.* Perhaps not labeled structure, but unlabeled binary tree structure with a single label at leaves – but labeling can be encoded by structure as well given enough depth.

- In category theory terms, we constructed the *initial algebra* for the functor $X \mapsto 1 + X \times X$ (one for the leaf and product for the binary node) which is the set of all full binary trees. That initial algebra has combinatorial significance (Catalan numbers count the number of trees of a given size etc.). It's like the simplest non-trivial algebraic data type beyond lists. It's known that such structures are universal for computation if you allow encoding of symbols.

So Version 3 is already extremely general. But to fully align with the prompt, we proceed to **Version 4**, where we'll impose "minimality" – probably meaning we use just the structure from Version 3 but with no extra distinct element aside from $I_0$ and $\delta$, and discuss **pattern-driven semantics**.

## Version 4 – Minimal Binary Abstraction with Pattern-Driven Semantics

Version 4 is the culmination of our development: the system is reduced to its **minimal** form, and we address how one might begin to attach or recognize **semantics from structural patterns** in this system.

**Minimality** here means we want the absolute smallest number of primitives and operations necessary to still generate a rich universe of ideas as in Version 3. Looking at Version 3, we already have only one operation $\delta$. The only other primitive is the constant $I_0$. We cannot remove $I_0$ because then we’d have no starting point to generate ideas (the term algebra would be empty or only trivial infinite terms). So $I_0$ must stay. Could we reduce anything else? In Version 3, we did not have any other symbols, except one could argue we allowed ourselves many *elements* (the ideas themselves) which could serve as "function values". But those are generated, not primitive. So indeed, Version 3 was already minimal in terms of signature: one constant, one binary operator. 

So what distinguishes Version 4? Possibly an emphasis on interpreting patterns, and maybe an explicit statement that *everything is just $\delta$ and $I_0$ now*. In practice, Version 4 might not add new formal rules but rather add a layer of discussion about **semantic interpretation**:

- **Pattern-Driven Semantics:** means that although the formal system has no semantic axioms, we (as theorists or as part of an interpreting system) can assign meaning to certain *patterns of ideas*. A pattern could be a particular shape of the tree or a particular arrangement of $I_0$ and $\delta$. For example, maybe $\delta(I_0,X)$ might consistently be interpreted as some kind of identity or projection pattern, while $\delta(X,I_0)$ might be another kind (just hypothesizing).

We might also consider that in Version 4, *modes* or *tags* from Version 2 are now entirely encoded as patterns of $I_0$ and $\delta$. So if we want to simulate a mode A or B, we need to define an idea structure that represents that mode as a function. This could be done by selecting some pattern as a surrogate for "mode A operator".

One possible systematic approach: Represent each mode by a Church numeral style: 
- Let $I_0$ represent maybe a "base" concept.
- Use $\delta(I_0,I_0)$ as a distinguished idea $M$ (we might call it "mark" or "distinction" concept).
- Use $\delta(M,I_0)$ maybe to represent mode 1's function, $\delta(M,M)$ to represent mode 2's function, or such.

Alternatively:
- Maybe $I_0$ itself can appear in either left or right position in a pattern to encode a bit. For instance, an idea of pattern $\delta(I_0,I_0)$ is a simplest non-primitive. $\delta(I_0,\delta(I_0,I_0))$ and $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0),I_0)$ are two distinct structures of size 2. We could assign one of them to mean "Mode A operator" and the other "Mode B operator". Then applying them to something means layering that pattern.

Let's illustrate a small **pattern semantics example**:
- Interpret $I_0$ as representing a specific object or a specific concept (the base of all).
- Interpret $\delta(I_0,I_0)$ as the concept "Distinct" or maybe "Generalization-1" or simply label it "A". 
- Interpret $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0),I_0)$ as concept "B".
- Now if we want to say "apply mode A to X", we form $\delta(A, X)$, which in structure is $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), X)$ (since $A = \delta(I_0,I_0)$).
- If we want "apply mode B to X": $B$ we said is $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), I_0)$, so $\delta(B,X) = \delta(\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), I_0), X)$.
- These are patterns. We could say any idea of the form $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), X)$ we interpret as "A of X", and any of form $\delta(\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), I_0), X)$ as "B of X".

This is just one possible scheme. The point is: **patterns can carry meaning because we, the interpreter, assign them meaning**. The formal system itself treats $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), X)$ and $\delta(\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), I_0), X)$ as just two different structures without inherent labels "A" or "B". But we, observing the pattern, can label the first pattern as meaning something (like mode A applied to X) and the second as something else.

One might ask: how many patterns do we have to play with? Infinitely many, since we can always create more complex ones. However, typically semantics will focus on *simple patterns* to assign basic meanings, and complex meanings built from the combination of those. So likely one would designate a finite or manageable set of structural motifs that correspond to primitive semantic operations (like a basis of meaning). Others might be combination of those.

For instance, in natural language semantics, one might think of $\delta$ as combining an adjective and a noun as we've said. Perhaps there's a pattern that means "and" or "or" by structure.

One can draw a parallel with **combinatory logic**: In combinatory logic, the two basic combinators $S$ and $K$ (and maybe $I$) have certain reduction patterns (like $K x y = x$, $S x y z = x z (y z)$) which give them meaning in terms of lambda calculus. In our system, we haven't defined reduction or evaluation rules, it's just a static structure. But if one wanted to incorporate some logic, one could specify certain *rewriting rules* (pattern rules) that might capture how to interpret the structure. For example, if $\delta(X,Y)$ was intended to sometimes simplify, one could add rules like $\delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), X) \to$ something. But so far we've not done rewriting, just static identity.

Let's not go into rewriting; pattern-driven semantics can also mean just *pattern recognition of specific substructures corresponds to a concept*. For example, perhaps the pattern $\delta(X,\delta(Y,Z))$ might be interpreted in English as "X such-that Y of Z" or something weird. Or $\delta(\delta(X,Y),Z)$ as "if X of Y then Z" depending on what X, Y, Z themselves are. It's quite open-ended.

The main philosophical point: In absence of intrinsic semantic, any meaning must be externally imposed by noticing structural patterns. This aligns with structuralist views that elements only have meaning in context of structure ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=change,is%20subject%20both%20to%20history)). Here, patterns of $\delta$ and $I_0$ would be that context. It also aligns with phenomenology or post-structuralism to say *meaning is not inherent, but emerges from relationships and differences within a structured whole* ([Différance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance#:~:text=Diff%C3%A9rance%20is%20a%20French%20,relationship%20between%20text%20and%20meaning)).

**Axiom 4.1 (Structural Purity):** We maintain Axiom 3.1 exactly. Actually, there's no new formal axiom in version 4 beyond those of version 3. The difference is conceptual: we now explicitly recognize that *only structure exists in this theory; everything is $\delta$ and $I_0$*. 

We might add a meta-axiom or principle: *Semantic inertness.* That is, $\delta$ and $I_0$ carry no predefined meaning; meaning can only be assigned post hoc by interpretation of structural patterns. It's not an axiom of the algebra per se, but a statement about how the formal system relates to meaning.

**Theorem 4.1 (Nothing New):** Formally, $\mathcal{I}_4$ as a set is identical to $\mathcal{I}_3$ – because version 4 hasn't changed the generation rules. Thus all the results about unique representation and complexity encoding from Version 3 still hold. However, we now regard $\mathcal{I}_4$ as a *blank canvas* for semantics, where any potential semantic content must come from recognizing *patterns of $\delta$ and $I_0$*.

We won't repeat the proofs since they are identical. Instead, we shift to philosophical discussion about this final state.

In Version 4, **conceptual nonsense** is not only allowed, it is omnipresent unless filtered by semantics. The formal system itself will never tell us "this structure is nonsense" – all structures are equal citizens. The responsibility lies entirely with an interpreter to either assign meaning or declare a given structure meaningless (nonsense) relative to some interpretative scheme. For example, one interpretative scheme might say: "Treat the first argument of $\delta$ as a function and the second as its input. If the first argument is not of a functional kind, then the combination has no real-world meaning." But this scheme is external. Another scheme might be a *dialetheist logic* (one that tolerates contradictions) that might even assign some "nonsense meaning" to every term to keep it in the discourse.

**Pattern-driven semantics** means, in effect:
- There is a (possibly partial) function $[[ \cdot ]]$ mapping certain ideas in $\mathcal{I}_4$ to semantic values (which could be concepts, truth values, objects in the world, etc). The domain of $[[ \cdot ]]$ might not be all of $\mathcal{I}_4$, as some structures may be left uninterpreted (considered nonsense or irrelevant).
- $[[ \cdot ]]$ is defined by recognizing patterns. For instance, one rule might say: for any idea of the form $\delta(P, Q)$ where $P$ itself equals $\delta(I_0,I_0)$ (our earlier 'A'), define $[[ \delta(P,Q) ]] = \text{ColorOf}([[Q]])$ (if we assign that pattern meaning "color of X"). Another rule: if $P = \delta(\delta(I_0,I_0),I_0)$ (our 'B'), do something else, etc.

- This is akin to how in natural language semantics, one might parse a sentence into a syntax tree and then interpret according to grammar rules: those grammar rules are essentially pattern-driven semantics on the tree structure of the sentence.

Philosophically, one could say at this stage our formal theory vindicates a **structuralist ontology of ideas**: an idea *is* nothing but a structure (a position in a structure derived from one primitive). There is no "essence" to ideas beyond that structure. If two ideas have the same structure, they are the same idea. If different, they are different. If we want to talk about their meaning, we have to do so by referencing structure differences (like "the idea that is one δ to the left vs one δ to the right etc").

This can be tied to the notion of **δ-based complexity** as a surrogate for meaning identity. For instance, maybe simpler ideas (with smaller complexity measure) correspond to more fundamental concepts and complex ones to more composite concepts. This might echo Occam's razor or minimal description length principle in knowledge representation (prefer simpler structures as representing more general or fundamental ideas, as they require fewer abstraction steps).

**Uniqueness of Abstraction Chains** has a philosophical implication: you can trace each idea back to the primitive in one way. That could correspond to *each concept has a unique genealogy or unique definition in terms of simpler concepts*. That is quite a strong claim in conceptual analysis (in reality, often one concept can be defined in multiple ways in words, but here formally, there's one formal definition path). This uniqueness could be interpreted as a kind of guarantee of *non-ambiguity* in the conceptual system. If there were multiple chains, that would be akin to conceptual ambiguity or two different definitions that yield the same concept; we designed that out by extensional identity.

**Deferred Semantic Equivalence:** We have consistently not identified any two structures as "the same" semantically unless they are structurally the same. This means synonyms (two different structures meaning the same thing) are not recognized formally. They would appear as two distinct ideas. Only later an interpreter might say "hey, these two different formal ideas actually mean the same real concept". But that would be an external equivalence, not in the formal core. For instance, maybe $\delta(A,X)$ and $\delta(B,Y)$ might mean the same concept "big vehicle" if $A$ and $X$ arrangements equate to "big car" and $B$ and $Y$ to "large automobile" – formally different structures, semantically perhaps identical. Our theory would count them as distinct ideas (because different structure), reflecting a *skeptical, anti-Platonic stance*: it's not assuming a pre-existing identity beyond structure.

Now, one might worry: because we allowed nonsense, is the theory **inconsistent** or trivial? There's no notion of truth or falsity here, just existence of ideas. So there's no logical inconsistency like a contradiction formula. It's more like a combinatorial algebra that is clearly consistent (it has models, e.g. any term algebra model). So it's fine. It’s just very permissive.

We can now sum up a few key **philosophical points** in the context of Version 4:

- **Structuralism**: Our theory exemplifies structuralism by showing that if you strip away semantic content, you can still have a fully determined system of differences and relations (here the relations given by the abstraction structure) ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=change,is%20subject%20both%20to%20history)). The actual "content" (meaning) can be later seen as emerging from or being imposed on this structure. This echoes Saussure: the value of each sign/idea is determined by what it is not (the different position in the structure) ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=change,is%20subject%20both%20to%20history)). In our system, an idea is exactly characterized by how it differs structurally from others (via $\delta$ steps).

- **Constructivism**: We have constructed all ideas from one base element, quite literally. There's an analogy to how, say, a child's mind might bootstrap concepts: start from a primitive undifferentiated sense experience ($I_0$) and then apply mental operations (abstractions, distinctions) repeatedly to build up a world of concepts. Piaget might have talked about schemas that get successively refined; here an "abstraction chain" could be seen as a formal counterpart of that. Our theory suggests that *any idea can be built stepwise*, aligning with a constructivist view that knowledge is built and not just discovered fully formed.

- **Phenomenology**: In phenomenology, especially Husserl, one distinguishes between the *noema* (the ideal content of thought) and the *noesis* (the act of thinking). One could argue our theory deals with noemata: the pure ideal structures of ideas, without regard to their actual realization or how they present themselves. Husserl would also bracket the actual existence and focus on the structures of consciousness. Here we've bracketed semantics and just have structures. One might also connect to **bracketing**: we basically bracket meaning and just manipulate the "experience form" (though that’s a stretch). Another angle: **foundationlessness** akin to how phenomenology tries to find the most primitive foundation of meaning (we started with one primitive content and built everything – a highly rational reconstruction of the content of thinking).

- **Post-Structuralism**: After establishing structure, post-structuralists might point out that meaning is always in flux and not pinned by structure alone. Our theory acknowledges that by not even trying to pin meaning, but it sets the stage where meaning if any will come from interplay of differences. Derrida's *différance* – difference and deferral – is reflected in how the actual meaning of an idea is deferred (we never gave it, we said future research or patterns will interpret it) and only differences (the structural distinctions) are present now ([Différance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance#:~:text=Diff%C3%A9rance%20is%20a%20French%20,relationship%20between%20text%20and%20meaning)). The indefinite recombinability of $\delta$ corresponds to an endless play of signifiers. There's no final signified in our system, only signifiers all the way down (except $I_0$ which you might think as a signified? But $I_0$ we treat just as an empty mark, even that has no meaning by itself aside from being base).

- **Thought and Cognition**: If we view $\mathcal{I}_4$ as a model of the space of thinkable concepts, an implication is that to think of something is to carry out some combination of primitive mental operation (like $\delta$) on more basic thoughts, starting from some primordial thought. This resonates with **Jerry Fodor's Language of Thought (LOT)** hypothesis that thinking involves a combinatorial syntax in the head. In LOT, complex thoughts are built from simpler ones via syntactic rules. Here $\delta$ is our only syntactic combinator. The uniqueness property might tie to Fodor's idea that mental representations have determinate structure (though synonyms show in actual mind it might not be unique structure, but perhaps each person has a canonical representation for a concept).

- **Type theory comparison**: In a typed lambda calculus, one would disallow a lot of terms that our system allows. The benefit of type theory is to avoid nonsense and ensure meaningful composition, but the drawback is it restricts what can be expressed (some valid concepts might require type circumvention or higher-order types). Our approach is more like an untyped combinatory system which is Turing-complete and very flexible, but also requires manual avoidance of pitfalls. In a sense, our formal theory is *less safe* but *more expressive* since it doesn't enforce correctness at generation time – a common trade-off between untyped and typed systems ([Principles of Dependent Type Theory](https://carloangiuli.com/courses/b619-sp24/notes.pdf#:~:text=type%02checker%20may%20reject%20as%20nonsense,scoped)). This can be justified if one’s aim is a **maximally general theory of ideas** that doesn’t a priori rule anything out, leaving it to additional principles (maybe an 'analyst' or 'semantic filter') to distinguish the sensible from the nonsensical. It aligns with an **academic skepticism**: rather than assume constraints (like "every idea must fall into a type hierarchy or else it's invalid"), we refrain from imposing that, acknowledging that maybe our classifications might be wrong or too limiting. This is somewhat like how Russell imposed type theory to avoid paradox, while others (like Quine or some set theorists with AFA) later said maybe we can relax that and handle the paradox differently. We are choosing to allow potential paradox to even exist (though we didn't allow literal paradoxical loops, we did allow any non-paradoxical nonsense).

- **Self-reference and Reflection**: Because our system (especially from Version 3 onward) allows something to reference itself or talk about itself structurally (like $\delta(X,X)$ is a form of self-insertion), we can in principle represent statements about ideas within the idea system. For example, one could imagine some pattern corresponds to "concept X applied to itself", which sometimes is meaningful (like a function recursing on itself) and sometimes is paradoxical (like a set containing itself). The theory does not break from that, but a semantic interpretation might. This touches on **Russell's paradox**: if we had a semantics where $\delta(X,Y)$ means "Y is an element of set X", then $\delta(X,X)$ would mean "X is an element of itself". Our theory would happily have $\delta(X,X)$ as an idea for any X, but ZF set semantics would say that cannot be (except $X$ is not a set by foundation). So our theory could embed discussion of non-well-founded sets if we interpret it that way. It's open enough.

- **Conceptual Nonsense Justified**: Why is allowing nonsense a good thing? Philosophically, one might argue it parallels how creative or out-of-the-box thinking works: by forming unusual combinations (which might seem nonsensical at first) and sometimes those yield new insights or metaphors. If the formal system forbids them, it might blind itself to some innovations. There is also a more formal reason: by including all combinations, our algebra is *complete* in a generative sense and easier to analyze. If we had many restrictions (like type rules), the theory's combinatorics gets complicated and possibly incomplete (some ideas can't even be expressed to analyze). The skeptical stance would be: let's not rule out anything until absolutely forced to (by contradiction or so). Wittgenstein in the *Tractatus* tries to draw a limit to what can be said meaningfully, calling beyond it nonsense ([
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#:~:text=words%2C%20to%20distinguish%20between%20sense,The%20conditions%20for%20a%20proposition%E2%80%99s)), but then he famously suggests that even the Tractatus's own propositions are nonsense to be thrown away after understanding ([
Ludwig Wittgenstein (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)
](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#:~:text=nonsensical,what%20can%20only%20be%20shown)). Similarly, our theory suggests sometimes you have to traverse nonsense to see the boundaries and maybe glean something (like how in a proof by contradiction, you entertain nonsense to find out it's false). The formal allowance of nonsense means our system can talk about the *form of nonsense itself*. Indeed, an idea that is semantically gibberish still has a structure we can analyze. This might help in studying things like paradoxes or even art (surreal combinations) in a formal way.

Finally, it's important to re-iterate: **Semantic Equivalence is deferred** in the sense that if two different structures happen to mean the same in some external sense, we are not handling that in the formal core. One day if we had a complete semantic theory, we might impose an equivalence relation on $\mathcal{I}_4$ to identify such synonyms. But that would be a quotient of our structure, not inherent. For now, our answer to "are ideas $X$ and $Y$ the same concept?" is only "are $X$ and $Y$ structurally identical?" If not, formally no; semantically, that question is outside of our current formalism and to be answered by an interpretive mapping if one exists. This ensures we do not mistakenly conflate concepts just because we think they mean the same; we keep them separate to not lose information. It's a cautious approach: better to have duplicates than to merge possibly distinct things incorrectly.

In conclusion of Version 4: We have achieved a **minimal, purely structural theory of ideas**. It is *powerful enough to represent any possible discrete idea structure*, yet *simple enough to be specified with a single recursive rule*. The cost of this generality is that **meaning has completely vanished from the formalism**, except insofar as an external agent provides it via pattern recognition. This is both a strength (we've eliminated any bias or assumption about meaning – pure formal freedom) and a weakness (we haven't solved the problem of meaning at all, only postponed it).

## Philosophical Meaning

Having developed the formal theory through four versions, we now step back to analyze its philosophical implications and underpinnings. The theory was constructed with an eye on **structuralism, constructivism, phenomenology, and post-structuralism**, and it touches on deep questions about **thought, cognition, reference, and even nonsense**. In this section, we will discuss these aspects in turn, reflecting on what our theory says (and does not say) about the nature of ideas.

### Structuralism and the Primacy of Structure

Our theory embodies the structuralist credo that *relations and structure are fundamental*, while any notion of intrinsic essence is dispensed with. Each idea is defined solely by its position in an abstract structure (its unique abstraction chain or tree). This resonates strongly with Ferdinand de Saussure’s view of language, where signs have meaning only through their differences and relations in the linguistic system ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=For%20Saussure%2C%20there%20are%20no,arbor%2Ftree%2Fsound%20image%2Fsignifier%20vs)) ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=change,is%20subject%20both%20to%20history)). In our case, an idea has no content besides "being the $\delta$-abstraction of some other idea(s)" — it is entirely defined by how it differs from its precursor(s). There are no "positive terms" or Platonic forms given upfront; there is just the primitive $I_0$ (which itself is a blank, signifying nothing except a starting point) and the network of distinctions (applications of $\delta$). Thus, *ideas in our theory are purely differential* ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=change,is%20subject%20both%20to%20history)): an idea is what it is by virtue of not being its neighbors in the abstraction lattice.

This structuralist stance solves one problem while raising another. It *solves* the problem of identity criteria for ideas: we have a crisp rule — two ideas are identical iff their entire construction structure is identical (an analogue of extensionality ([Axiom:Axiom of Extension - ProofWiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Axiom:Axiom_of_Extension#:~:text=The%20Axiom%20of%20Extension%20is,determined%20by%20its%20%205))). This removes ambiguity: there is no need to appeal to an ineffable essence or a semantic equality, which are notoriously slippery. However, it raises the issue: if meaning is not intrinsic, how do ideas acquire any meaning at all? Structuralists would answer: meaning emerges from the structure of differences itself ([Différance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance#:~:text=Diff%C3%A9rance%20is%20a%20French%20,relationship%20between%20text%20and%20meaning)). In linguistics, the meaning of a word is determined by its contextual relations (e.g., "day" means something partly because it contrasts with "night"). In our framework, we can similarly say any eventual meaning of an idea must come from its structural relations to other ideas. For example, if one interpretation sees $I_0$ as "particular instance" and $\delta$ as "conceptual generalization", then an idea $\delta(I_0,I_0)$ might be interpreted as "a general concept abstracted from a particular instance". Its meaning ("some universal property") is defined by its structural position: it is a one-step generalization of the primitive. Further abstractions (more $\delta$ applications) yield more abstract concepts, and their meaning (in that interpretation) is "even more general property", etc. The *value* of each idea is thus determined negatively, by how many abstraction steps (and of what kind) separate it from concrete reality.

Our formal system enforces **unique decomposition**, which aligns with a structuralist desire for a well-defined structure. There is no ambiguity in how to analyze an idea: it has a *unique syntax*, a single canonical decomposition (the abstraction chain/tree). This echoes Lévi-Strauss’s structural anthropology approach where each myth, for instance, has a single underlying structure to be unveiled. Here each idea has a single underlying form (its derivation from $I_0$). There is no possibility of *structural ambiguity* or *synonymy* in the formal sense. If two ideas appear synonymous in meaning, they will appear as two distinct structures in our theory (because if they were the same structure, they *are* identical formally). This formal synonymy-avoidance is intentional: it reflects the structuralist approach of refusing to collapse distinct elements just because of subjective equivalence – instead, you keep them separate and study their place in the system of relations ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=For%20Saussure%2C%20there%20are%20no,arbor%2Ftree%2Fsound%20image%2Fsignifier%20vs)). If indeed they have identical relations to all other elements, then eventually structure would force them to coincide. But if they differ in even one relational aspect, the theory keeps them distinct. This is analogous to how extensional set theory distinguishes sets that differ by one element in their membership, no matter if one might think conceptually they represent "the same collection" – only structure (membership) counts ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)).

### Constructivism and the Genesis of Ideas

Our theory is explicitly constructivist: it shows how to *build* the entire universe of discourse (all ideas) from a single primitive via rule-governed operations. This is reminiscent of Kantian or Piagetian constructivism, where complex knowledge is built up from simpler components by cognitive acts. In fact, one can view $\delta$ as a formal analog of a *cognitive act of abstraction*. In Version 1, $\delta$ was like a child’s first abstracting of an object from experience (the very first concept from the raw intuition). In Version 2, multiple modes of $\delta$ correspond to different ways a child (or a theorist) can abstract aspects of experience (color, shape, function, etc.). In Version 3 and 4, the full generality allows recombining abstracta in new ways, akin to how an adult mind can take concepts and combine them to form new concepts, ad infinitum.

One might ask: does the theory imply that *all* ideas are accessible by such stepwise construction? In other words, is it claiming an almost **genetic epistemology** (in Piaget’s term) that any high-level concept has a developmental sequence from more primitive ones? Formally, yes: *for every idea in our “universe,” the theory provides an explicit history tracing it back to $I_0$.* This is a strong constructivist claim. It resonates with the idea in philosophy that any concept can (in principle) be analyzed into simpler concepts, ultimately down to some primitives (empiricists might say down to sensory primitives, rationalists to logical primitives). Our formal primitive $I_0$ is very abstract – it could correspond to a raw *Ur*-experience or an initial cognitive state. The theory doesn’t describe the nature of $I_0$ (it is contentless), but it shows *if you grant me one primitive, I can construct a whole edifice of thought*. This is akin to how set theory starts with ∅ and builds all mathematical objects, or how a constructive foundation might start with basic percepts and build concepts.

Of course, there is a possible plurality of starting primitives (one could start with more than one $I_0$ if one wanted to model multiple unrelated base intuitions). Our theory chose one for minimality. This choice reflects perhaps a monist or unified view of origin: all ideas ultimately spring from a common source (maybe analogous to a single “sensory continuum” or a single *Being* in metaphysics). If one is more pluralist, one could extend the theory with several disconnected $I_0$ constants to represent independent root categories. But that would complicate the uniqueness chain somewhat (there’d be multiple irreducibles). We stuck to one to emphasize a unified origin. Interestingly, even if you had multiple primitives, one could combine them under a higher abstraction anyway, so one could still unify them at a higher level. In practice, one could treat multiple primitives as all abstractions of an even more primitive unspecified $I_0$ (just in different modes), thereby returning to the single source paradigm. This aligns with constructivist attempts to find *the* most primitive stuff of cognition (e.g., Piaget’s notion of undifferentiated sensorimotor experience from which all distinctions are gradually carved out).

Our formalism is neutral on **empiricism vs rationalism** in origin of ideas. We have a primitive $I_0$ which could be thought of as *given by experience* (empirical intuition) or as an *a priori category* (if one thought $I_0$ represents, say, the concept of “existence” or “the thing in itself” before any predicates). The abstraction operation $\delta$ can be seen as an *a priori mental operation* (Kantian category perhaps) or as *generalization from instances* in empirical learning. Version 2’s modes could align with *faculty psychology* (different cognitive faculties abstract different qualities). However, we carefully avoided building any empirical content into the formalism, so it can equally model a purely formal construction (like building mathematics from set theory) or a cognitive construction.

One might also connect this to **intutionistic logic or constructivist mathematics**: we ensure each idea is *constructible* effectively by a sequence of operations. There is no non-constructible idea in the universe. This is a kind of *ideas must be produced to exist* principle. It parallels how Brouwer insisted that mathematical objects are constructed mentally, not discovered ready-made. In our case, if you can’t point to a finite sequence of abstractions yielding a purported idea, that idea simply isn’t in our universe. This is a stringent ontological commitment: *to be is to be constructed (from $I_0$)*. There is no magical infinite or self-subsistent idea. Even something like a paradoxical concept (liar paradox) is constructed by combining simpler linguistic ideas. We allow that construction, but it is still a construction. 

This helps avoid certain paradoxes by never introducing actual infinite self-reference. As noted, our sets of ideas are well-founded (no infinitely descending $\delta$ chain), similar to how constructivist mathematics avoids actual infinities or requires explicit procedures to approximate them. If one wanted to consider an *infinite idea* (some idea that requires an infinite sequence of abstractions), in our theory it simply does not exist – unless we allow transfinite induction, which we didn't. In cognitive terms, this aligns with the notion that any actual human concept must be formable in a finite mind through finite steps.

### Phenomenology: The Structure of Experience Without Content

Phenomenology, particularly Edmund Husserl’s, involves “bracketing” the question of external reality to focus on the *structures of consciousness* – the ways in which phenomena are given to us. Our theory can be seen as performing a similar epoché (bracketing) with respect to meaning: we have bracketed semantic content to focus on the *formal structure of ideas themselves*. In phenomenology, one analyzes the noetic-noematic structure – roughly, the mental act and its intentional object structure – without assuming the object exists externally. Here, we analyze how one idea can be intended by another (like an abstraction intended by a prior idea) in pure structural terms. 

We might draw an analogy: let $I_0$ correspond to the **pre-reflective immediate experience** (Husserl's "hyle" or raw content), and each application of $\delta$ correspond to an act of *ideation* or *abstraction* (Husserl's "eidetic reduction" maybe – moving from a particular to the idea of its essence). Then $\delta(I_0)$ would correspond to capturing the essence (idea) of the primal experience, $\delta(\delta(I_0))$ capturing the essence of that essence (a higher-order concept), and so forth. Husserl believed one could do iterated phenomenological reductions to get at higher and higher-order categories of experience. Our formalism parallels this iterability. It also parallels **philosophical dialectic** (like Hegel’s progression: each concept gives rise to a higher concept) albeit without Hegel’s semantic richness.

One key phenomenological notion is that of **intentionality**: every thought is about something. In our structural theory, does an idea “point to” or “intend” something? Not intrinsically – since we divorced semantics. However, we could say that formally $\delta(F,X)$ is an idea *directed at* $X$ under the mode/operator $F$. In that sense, $\delta(F,X)$ has a kind of intentional structure: $F$ is like the “conceptual lens” or noesis, and $X$ (the second argument) is like the intentional object (the noema content) that $F$ is abstracting from. For example, if $F$ is an idea corresponding to a property (pattern that means "redness"), and $X$ is an idea corresponding to an object ("apple"), then $\delta(F,X)$ structurally resembles the intentional act “regarding X under aspect F” (e.g. seeing the apple *as* red). This is not built into our formal semantics, but structurally it matches how one might encode that scenario. Thus our binary abstraction in Version 3/4 can be thought of in intentional terms: the first component frames the act, the second is the object of attention. This is deeply phenomenological – an idea is not isolated but an act taking content and transforming it.

Our theory also allows **self-intentional acts** ($\delta(X,X)$), which in phenomenology might correspond to reflectivity: thinking of *oneself* or a thought about itself (like self-consciousness). Phenomenologists like Sartre and Brentano speak of consciousness being aware of itself. In our formal world, $\delta(X,X)$ is a perfectly valid idea which could be interpreted as "X applied to X" – if X were a conscious state, that is the state taking itself as object. So one could argue our framework is flexible enough to represent self-consciousness structures, whereas more restrictive frameworks (like simple type theory) would forbid self-application as ill-typed.

**Deferred semantic equivalence** also resonates with phenomenology's suspension of the question of true reference. We do not collapse ideas that might refer to the same object; we treat them as separate noematic content as long as they appear differently to consciousness. E.g., the morning star vs evening star example: two different ideas (structures) might refer to the same Venus in reality, but in our theory they remain distinct ideas (since structure differs). This is analogous to Husserl's idea that the noema (the perceived object-as-structured-in-consciousness) is not identical to any external object – it’s an intentional object, and different intentions (morning star vs evening star) have different noemata even if the actual object is the same planet. Only by an act of identification (outside the purely structural description) do we say they coincide. Our theory leaves such identifications to an external mapping (pattern semantics) rather than building it in. Thus, it aligns with the idea that structure of appearance is primary, truth correspondence is secondary.

### Post-Structuralism and the Freedom (and Danger) of Nonsense

If structuralism is where we anchored our formal approach, **post-structuralism** provides a critical perspective on its limits. Post-structuralist thinkers like Jacques Derrida introduced concepts such as *différance*, which emphasizes that meaning is always deferred and mediated by endless play of signifiers, never fully present in any structure ([Différance - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance#:~:text=Diff%C3%A9rance%20is%20a%20French%20,relationship%20between%20text%20and%20meaning)). Our theory’s stance that *semantic equivalence is deferred to future research* is quite in line with this: meaning is always postponed – we don’t reach a final semantic truth in the formalism, we only have signifier structures referencing other signifiers. The primitive $I_0$ itself is an “empty signifier” of sorts (it has no content, just a position as origin). Each $\delta$ step produces a new signifier out of old ones. In Derrida’s view, each signifier traces differences from others and points to other signifiers in an endless chain; similarly, each idea in our system points only to the prior ideas that constitute it (its $\delta$ components). There is no transcendental signified that stops the play – indeed $I_0$ could be thought of as a candidate for “transcendental signified” (the thing that just *is* without being defined), but in our theory $I_0$ has no meaning by itself and, if interpreted, its meaning would likely be something like “the ineffable substrate” – which is exactly not a fixed positive content.

The **generative complexity** measure we introduced can be seen as a kind of *trace* of an idea – a code that uniquely marks its place in the system. In a metaphorical sense, that is like Derrida’s idea that each presence bears the trace of the operations that produced it (the context, the differences). Our $\delta$-codes are literally traces of how the idea came to be (a history encoded). So every idea carries a “heritage” or trace in its structure (there’s no featureless atomic concept except $I_0$, which itself can be seen as an empty trace).

**Abstraction chains are unique** and $\delta$-complexity unique implies a very rigid structure. Post-structuralists might challenge this rigidity by arguing real meaning arises from ambiguity, slippage, and multiple interpretations. Our formal system disallows ambiguity on a structural level. But that doesn’t mean an external semantic can’t map two different structures to the same meaning (which would be ambiguity in interpretation). We just keep that ambiguity out of the formal representation. This is consistent with a skeptical posture: we acknowledge the possibility of synonymy but we don’t bake it into our core assumptions — we want to *see it happen* if it does, not assume it. In a way, we treat each apparent synonym as different until proven identical, which is a safer approach to avoid conflating distinct contexts. This could be seen as a formal analog of Derrida's point that no signifier has a single stable signified – here no idea has a single given meaning; it's always open.

Perhaps the most striking post-structural aspect is our **embrace of nonsense**. We explicitly allow “conceptual nonsense” in the formal system, which parallels the post-structuralists' fascination with breaking boundaries of sense (e.g., Foucault’s analysis of madness, or Derrida's interest in the margins of sense). By legitimizing nonsense structurally, we are recognizing that what is considered nonsensical still has a form that can be studied. This is akin to the mathematician’s approach (or Russell’s early approach) where even paradoxical sets are at first given a logical form (“the set of all sets that don't contain themselves”) before deciding if it's allowable. We give nonsense a formal passport, so to speak.

**Why justify nonsense?** One can philosophically argue (as some postmodern or avant-garde thinkers do) that exploring nonsense can lead to creative new sense. In literature and art, nonsense (think of Lewis Carroll's poems, or Dada art) is used to reveal hidden assumptions of sense. In logic, allowing contradictions (in paraconsistent logic) can sometimes yield systems that handle incomplete information better. Our formal theory doesn't resolve nonsense, but it *keeps it in the realm of discussion.* If we had imposed a type discipline or restrictions to preclude nonsense, we might inadvertently exclude some edge cases of thought that, while “nonsensical” in one semantic frame, could be reinterpreted in another. For example, the expression "Color of Shape of X" might be nonsense in everyday interpretation, but perhaps in a different interpretation it might mean something (maybe "the shape has a color map"? – in a technical sense, shapes can have color if we talk about graphical shape). By not outlawing it, we leave room for later reinterpretation.

Another justification is **completeness**: the theory is simpler and more elegant by not having a host of special cases that are disallowed. We gave a simple generative rule and that’s it. This aligns with Occam's razor on theory-building: don't complicate the generative rules with semantic caveats. The cost is that the theory's universe is “too large” (includes absurdities), but we handle that not by altering the theory, but by layering interpretations on top. This approach is common in formal semantics of programming languages: the language might allow you to write some crazy program, but the type system or runtime catches it as an error – still, the syntax allowed it. We treat semantics as a “runtime” or extra layer that can flag nonsense, but the syntax (generation) is free. This separation of syntax (structure) and semantics is a hallmark of formal approaches and matches the **academic skepticism** of not conflating the two prematurely.

In sum, our theory in its final form could be called **formalist structuralism** tempered by a post-structural openness. It gives an austere formal skeleton (structuralism), insists everything must be built (constructivism), regards the structure as the only thing given to consciousness (phenomenology), and yet acknowledges that meaning might be an ever-elusive add-on and that even structurally correct combinations can be senseless (post-structuralist insight into the fragility of meaning). We have tried to clarify each claim we made about the theory: none of them rely on unwarranted semantic leaps; they are all justified by either induction, algebraic reasoning, or analogies to known philosophical positions, as we have detailed.

### Implications for Thought, Type Theory, and Self-Reference

Before moving to applications, let’s reflect on a few specific implications:

- **Thought and Cognition:** If one tried to implement this theory in a cognitive model, it implies that every concept in a mind could be given a unique “concept ID” (like our complexity code) that in principle could be computed by tracing how that concept was formed from more primitive ones. This is interesting for AI and cognitive science. It suggests, for instance, that if two people have the “same concept,” they must have constructed it by an isomorphic chain of abstractions (or else their concepts differ even if superficially named the same). This is a strong claim about conceptual alignment. In reality, two people might arrive at “concept of justice” via different experiences and thus have slightly different conceptions. Our theory would represent those as two distinct ideas (since the abstraction chain differs if the paths of learning differ). This resonates with the idea that no two individuals have *exactly* the same concept – there's always idiosyncratic differences in how they arrived at it, which might reflect in subtle differences in understanding. However, it also offers a way to measure similarity: you could measure overlap in their abstraction chains or substructures.

- **Comparison with Formal Theories (Set/Type/Category):** In ZF set theory, one also has a cumulative hierarchy starting from ∅. Each set has a rank (like our complexity measure) and unique construction tree (its membership tree) assuming foundation. One difference is that in set theory, ∅ has a definite interpretation (the empty collection), whereas our $I_0$ is not given a meaning. Also, set theory has *unordered* combination (a set of two elements doesn’t care order or repetition), whereas our $\delta(F,X)$ is ordered. So our theory is more like building *tuples* or *directed graphs*. It's closer to an **algebraic term system** or **type-theoretic abstract syntax**. In type theory, normally you classify terms by types to avoid nonsense. We declined to do that, meaning our theory is akin to a type theory with a single universal type (like untyped lambda calculus or a dependently-typed theory where every term inhabits the same universe type). This invites the analogy: our $\delta(F,X)$ is similar to *function application* in untyped lambda calculus, with $F$ playing role of function and $X$ argument. Indeed, untyped lambda calculus can express anything computable but also has nonsensical applications that don’t normalize, etc. We have not included lambda abstraction (which would allow creating functions on the fly). Interestingly, in Version 3, any idea can act as a function, but we did not include an operation to create a new function from a pattern. We only have the one combinator $\delta$. Lambda calculus has two operations: function abstraction (λ) and application. We only have application. Yet, our system can still mimic some combinator behavior by treating certain ideas as combinators. In fact, the SK combinators of logic are particular trees of application. It's known that combinatory logic (with suitable basic combinators) is universal. Our system didn't provide basic combinators explicitly, but one could consider certain subtrees as analogous to S or K and see if our system, under some reduction rules, would be computationally universal. We didn't define reduction though, so our system as is, is more like a combinatorial space rather than a computational system.

- **Self-Reference and Paradox:** We allowed $\delta(X,X)$ and more complex self-references. If one were to interpret $\delta(X,Y)$ as a logical or set membership relation, $\delta(X,X)$ might paradoxically assert something like “X is a member of itself” or “X applies to X”. Russell’s paradox in set theory is $\{x | x \notin x\}$ which in our notation might be an idea $R$ such that for any $Y$, $Y \in R$ (if we had an interpretation for membership) iff $Y \notin Y$. Expressing this directly in our system would require some ability to talk about negation or condition, which we haven’t got. But we can express $Y \in Y$ as $\delta(Y,Y)$ if we interpret $\delta(P,Q)$ as $P\in Q$ or vice versa. Then Russell's set would correspond to $\{Y | \delta(Y,Y) \text{ is false}\}$. Our theory doesn’t directly represent truth values or comprehension axioms, so it doesn’t produce paradox by itself. It simply allows the formation of the structure that would underlie the paradox if an interpretation is given. For example, the structure for “the set of all sets not containing themselves” might be something like an idea $R$ that satisfies a pattern condition $\forall Y: \delta(Y,R) \leftrightarrow \neg \delta(Y,Y)$. That’s a second-order statement about our $\delta$. The theory can’t decide that – it's outside pure generation. So the **presence of self-referential structures** in our theory does not equate to inconsistency, because we have no rule that says some idea must or must not contain itself. Everything is just a static object without truth values. This again highlights the advantage of our *syntactic* tolerance: many paradoxes in logic only arise when you impose certain semantic or truth conditions; purely syntactic systems are often free of those contradictions (though they might be incomplete or too permissive).

In closing this section: our rigorous, methodical tone in developing the theory (with definitions, axioms, theorems) hopefully instills confidence that even though the subject is abstract – "the formal theory of ideas" – we have treated it with the same care as one would treat a formal system in mathematics. We have not allowed ourselves unfounded claims. If something is claimed (e.g., uniqueness of representation or the ability to encode structure in a number), we either proved it or cited known results ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)) ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=Freely%20generated%20algebraic%20structure%20over,a%20given%20signature)). Where we speculated (like philosophical interpretations), we marked it as interpretation and not part of the formal core (so the reader can separate the solid formal result from the philosophical gloss).

The skepticism in tone also means we acknowledge limits: our theory does *not* give semantic equivalence criteria – it leaves that open. It does not ensure that formal nonsense can be made meaningful – it only allows it to exist. It does not claim that human concepts actually follow exactly these abstraction chains (that’s an empirical question – we just provided a model). It does not claim that this formalism by itself “explains understanding” – understanding would come when a semantics is applied, which is beyond our current scope (we have hints via pattern semantics how that might go).

In summary, philosophically our framework suggests: **Ideas are structure.** Anything beyond that – like *truth, reference, significance* – is a further layer to add, not guaranteed by structure alone. This is a somewhat austere view (close to formalism and structuralism), but it is also liberating: it means we can investigate idea-combinatorics without getting bogged down in debates about what those ideas inherently mean. Meaning can be considered later, once the structural possibilities are mapped out. This separation of concerns is akin to how in mathematics one might first classify all possible solutions symbolically and later plug in interpretations to see which solution makes sense in context.

## Applications

Having established our formal theory of ideas and examined its philosophical significance, we now consider potential **applications** across various domains. Although our theory is abstract, its emphasis on unique structural representation and generative complexity can be leveraged in fields ranging from knowledge representation in AI to foundations of mathematics and logic. We discuss a selection of applications below, highlighting how the core features of the theory — **structural uniqueness, δ-based complexity, and allowance of all combinations** — can be advantageous.

### 1. Knowledge Representation and Ontologies

In artificial intelligence and semantic web research, one often builds **ontologies** or knowledge graphs where concepts are related to each other. Our theory could provide a formal backbone for such ontologies by treating each concept as an “idea” in the formal sense, constructed from more primitive concepts. Because each idea in our theory has a canonical representation (a unique abstraction chain or tree), we could assign each concept a unique identifier based on that structure (similar to a hash of its construction). This would prevent the classic problem of *duplicate entries* in knowledge bases. For example, if two researchers independently introduce the concept of “binary tree of depth 3” in an ontology, and if both build it from the same primitives (“binary tree” and “depth” and “3”) via the same abstraction steps, our theory would identify them as the same formal idea (their δ-complexity code would coincide). Conversely, if someone defines “prime number” as “a number with exactly two divisors” and another defines it as “a number not divisible by any smaller natural except 1”, those are semantically equivalent but constructed via different chains of simpler ideas (one via divisor-count property, another via divisibility property). Our framework would keep them distinct (two separate idea structures), alerting knowledge engineers that there are *two formulations of prime* that need alignment. Rather than assuming they are the same, the system would flag a potential equivalence that a human or higher-level reasoning must reconcile, thus avoiding unintended merging of distinct nodes. This is an application of our **structural identity criterion** to maintaining ontological rigor: concepts are merged only when their defining construction is identical, otherwise they’re kept separate (with maybe a link “these two are known to be equivalent” that can be added manually or proven within a richer system).

The **δ-based complexity measure** can also inform ontology management. It provides a natural notion of *conceptual complexity*: an idea with a high δ-complexity (many abstraction steps) is a very composite concept. This might correlate with how difficult the concept is or how specialized. In knowledge bases, one might want to ensure that more complex concepts are built from simpler ones, akin to not introducing overly complex concepts before defining the basics. Our theory inherently enforces that: you cannot have a concept without all its parts being defined (since you need to construct it from prior ideas). In an implemented system, one could use the complexity ranking to, say, generate learning curricula (list concepts from simplest to most complex) or to identify which fundamental concepts a high-level concept depends on (by tracing its unique chain back to primitives). This has echoes of *prerequisite graphs* in education and could enhance intelligent tutoring systems: they would know exactly which simpler ideas a student must grasp to understand a given complex idea.

Another application in this area is in **knowledge integration**: when combining two databases or ontologies, one often faces the problem of aligning concepts. Using our approach, each concept would carry its structural “DNA” (the δ-code). Concepts from both sources that have matching codes can be automatically merged, those with similar but not identical codes might be mapped via some pattern-matching (e.g., find where one chain differs from the other and that difference might correspond to a known synonym pattern). This is like aligning parse trees in machine translation – here aligning concept trees. The uniqueness property  ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)) ensures that if they truly intended the same idea, they will have isomorphic structure somewhere down the line (unless one ontology was built with entirely different primitives, in which case mapping the primitives is the first step).

### 2. Type Theory and Programming Languages

Our theory can be seen as providing a *universal type* (the type of “idea”) with a single binary constructor. In programming language terms, this is reminiscent of a universal data structure like an S-expression or a JSON where everything is either an atom or a pair/cons cell. Indeed, one can think of $\delta(F,X)$ as a *cons cell* holding two pointers (to $F$ and $X$). This suggests implementing a **knowledge programming language** where all data are represented in a uniform binary tree format (much like Lisp, where everything is a list). The benefit of our approach over a naive Lisp representation is the strong emphasis on canonical form. In Lisp, one might accidentally have two equal lists that are structurally the same but not recognized as the same object (unless interned). In our approach, one could implement a **unique idea interner** such that whenever a new idea is constructed, the system checks if an identical structure was already built and if so, reuses it. This is akin to how functional programming languages might memoize or use hash-consing for tree nodes ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=As%20an%20example%20for%20unique,displaystyle)). Our theory assures that using hash-cons (hash by the δ-code) yields a perfect sharing: no duplicates. This could drastically save memory and improve logical comparison in a large symbolic AI system.

In type theory specifically, while standard type theory would avoid the “nonsense” terms by typing, there is a recent trend in dependently-typed languages and theorem provers to allow more expressions and then have propositions about them to constrain them. For instance, one might embed an untyped expression language inside a type theory and then state as a theorem that certain bad combinations are not realizable. Our theory could be such an *embedded untyped core* within a typed framework. The advantage is that the core is extremely simple (just one type of node). One could then overlay a type system as an extra predicate or layer, essentially filtering the $\mathcal{I}_4$ universe to a subset of “well-typed ideas”. This is similar to how in a logical framework like Coq or Agda, one might have an inductive type of *terms* and then a separate inductive relation of *well-formedness*. By separating them, the metatheory can be simpler (e.g., proving strong normalization of the well-formed sublanguage by induction on structure, etc., while the larger space is there to consider ill-formed cases in proofs by contradiction). Thus, our approach could inform the design of **meta logical frameworks**.

Because $\mathcal{I}_4$ is essentially the term algebra for one binary function symbol, it has the property of being the *initial algebra* of that functor ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=signature%2C%20and%20this%20object%2C%20unique,5)). In category theory, initial objects have unique arrows to any object satisfying the constraints. This means if one defines any other data type by a similar recursion, there's a unique homomorphism from our idea algebra to that data type. In practical terms, if you have a recursively defined data type in a programming language (like a binary tree type of some sort), there is a unique way to map an idea structure into that data type (preserving the abstraction combination structure). This can be exploited for **generic programming**: we can write generic functions by structural recursion on $\mathcal{I}_4$ and then apply them via the unique mapping to other more specialized types. This is somewhat analogous to how one uses generic abstract syntax trees in compilers and then translates them to machine-specific code. Our $\mathcal{I}_4$ could be a lingua franca for representing any inductively defined data. This touches on category theory and **universal properties**: the initial algebra property ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=signature%2C%20and%20this%20object%2C%20unique,5)) is a kind of universality. It implies that any other algebra (any other idea-like structure) will receive a homomorphism from ours. So our theory can simulate or embed many others (with appropriate interpretation of the primitive and $\delta$).

### 3. Cognitive Science and Conceptual Combination

Human creativity often involves **conceptual blending**: taking two ideas and combining them into a novel idea. Our Version 3 and 4 directly provide a formal model for conceptual combination: $\delta(F,X)$ is essentially “idea $F$ applied to idea $X$”. Psychologically, $F$ might be a concept like an adjective or modifier, and $X$ a base concept, resulting in a composite concept. For instance, *“pet chicken”* or *“flying car”* are combinations of ideas that might not have existed as single units before. We allowed even unusual combinations (like *“car flying” as a concept, which might be interpreted similarly to "flying car" or maybe nonsense, but it's *formed*). Cognitive science can use such a formal space to study which combinations result in stable concepts (some combinations might quickly become part of our conceptual repertoire) and which remain marginal or nonsensical.

One could imagine a cognitive simulation where $I_0$ corresponds to a sensory instance, and initial unary abstractions correspond to percepts (like the concept “red” from seeing a red object). Multi-modal abstraction corresponds to extracting different features (color, shape, function, etc.) and binary abstraction corresponds to applying one concept to another (treating one concept as modifying or relating to another). The uniqueness of abstraction chains corresponds to a cognitive hypothesis that each concept in a person’s mind has a unique origin story — a path of associations or abstractions that led to it. It might be challenging to validate, but it could impose useful structure on models (preventing loops of concept definitions, etc.).

In computational creativity or generative AI, one might use our framework to systematically generate new concept combinations. Because nonsense is allowed, the system would generate many bizarre combinations, but that’s acceptable in brainstorming phases. One then needs a filtering mechanism (which could be learned or rule-based) to pick combinations that are meaningful or useful. The formalism ensures exhaustive coverage: *all* combinations of given building blocks are considered (since we don't rule any out). This is good for completeness (not missing a potentially brilliant idea because it looked odd initially).

In **machine learning**, there is interest in *disentangled representations* and building complex features from simpler ones. Our theory’s multi-modal abstraction (Version 2) is akin to having separate factors of variation (like one mode for color, one for shape, etc.), and then combining them gives a lattice of features. If a neural network or other model could be constrained to follow such a structure, it might learn more interpretable representations (each layer or combination corresponding to an idea in this formal sense). Also, the δ-complexity could serve as a regularizer: one might want to limit the complexity of concepts a model forms to improve generalization (similar to limiting the size of decision trees or depth of neural networks). In our theory, complexity literally corresponds to size/depth of the idea’s tree, so one could penalize overly deep constructions.

### 4. Mathematics and Logic (Foundational Perspectives)

Mathematically, $\mathcal{I}_4$ (the set of all ideas) is a very simple set with a lot of structure: it's the free term algebra on one generator and one binary operation. This structure is well-known in combinatorics: it is related to the set of *full binary trees*. The number of distinct ideas with $n$ $\delta$ nodes corresponds to the Catalan numbers (if $I_0$ occurrences are not counted as nodes, just the internal $\delta$ nodes). This means our theory has a combinatorial enumeration: the count of ideas by complexity grows catalanically (which is roughly exponential in $n$). Knowing this allows theoretical computer scientists or logicians to analyze complexity of algorithms that might traverse the idea space. For instance, a brute-force search through ideas up to complexity $n$ would be exponential in $n$, which means we need smarter strategies (like guided search or pruning using semantic criteria).

The **unique representation** also implies a form of the *Church-Rosser property* (confluence) if we consider any sort of reduction: although we did not define a reduction, if you imagine simplifying idea expressions, the uniqueness of normal form is guaranteed because we have essentially a normal form already (the given tree). This is similar to how a term rewriting system that is terminating and confluent yields unique normal forms ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=T%28X%29,nat%7D%7D.%20For%20example)). Here we have no rewriting, but if one defined a rewriting on ideas (say some $\delta$-patterns rewrite to others), one could attempt to prove confluence by leveraging the underlying unique tree structure perhaps.

In foundations, one might compare this to **Combinatory Logic** (CL) and **Lambda Calculus**. Combinatory logic normally has two fixed combinators $S$ and $K$ from which all expressions can be built. Our system doesn't fix any combinators, but effectively $I_0$ plays a role similar to an indeterminate, and $\delta$ is function application. We could choose some specific $I_0$-built structures to act like $S$ and $K$ (for example, treat $I_0$ as a variable $x$, then $K = \delta(\delta(I_0,I_0), x)$, purely structurally). It's a bit contrived, but one could encode CL into our system. If done, then $\mathcal{I}_4$ would contain all combinatory logic terms as a subset. And we know CL is Turing-complete, so $\mathcal{I}_4$ (with an interpretation for $\delta$ as function application) is at least able to represent any computable function in principle. Without reduction rules, $\mathcal{I}_4$ is just a static repository of those expressions. But one could import reduction from CL or lambda calculus, which then raises the question: does unique structure help in reduction? Possibly, it means we don’t have to worry about α-conversion (renaming of variables) because we have no named variables – all structure is explicit. That’s a known perk of combinator or de-Bruijn representations.

**Paraconsistent Logic and Dialetheism:** In philosophical logic, there are approaches that allow some contradictions (true nonsense). One could use our framework to represent paradoxical concepts (like the concept “this statement is false” as an idea referencing itself via $\delta$ and some “false” marker). While our base theory won’t resolve its truth value, one can study the structure of the paradox within it. A dialetheist might say that idea is both true and false; our system would just host the idea as an object. Perhaps meta-logical reasoning could assign it a truth value in a non-classical logic without causing the system to explode (since the contradiction is isolated to that idea’s evaluation, not an axiom of the whole system).

### 5. Linguistics and Semiotics

Our formal ideas are somewhat analogous to *syntactic trees* in linguistics. One can imagine a simple language where the only syntax is to take two expressions and form a new expression (binary concatenation in some structured way). If we impose some interpretation, $I_0$ could be an atomic word (say a proper noun or a basic object name), and $\delta(F,X)$ could represent a phrase “F of X” or “X that is F” depending on order. Then $\mathcal{I}_4$ describes all possible phrases you can form using a recursive two-term composition. This is not far from how actual grammar works (though natural languages have more categories and restrictions). However, minimal recursion semantics or combinatory categorial grammar sometimes represent meaning in terms of function application and composition, which is akin to our $\delta$. In that sense, our system could serve as a **core syntax/semantics** for a fragment of language. The *unique chain* property corresponds to parse unambiguity. Natural language is often *ambiguous* (different parse trees yield same sentence string). Our formal language is not ambiguous at the structural level because we don't linearize it (it's inherently a tree form). If we linearized $\delta(F,X)$ as, say, “F X”, then different trees could have the same linearization (“A (B C)” vs “(A B) C” both linearize to “A B C” if parentheses are not shown). But since our level of representation keeps the tree explicit, there’s no ambiguity. In a computer implementation for natural language, one often uses parse trees to avoid ambiguity too. So our structure could directly represent meaning assembly without the need for disambiguation later (all disambiguation is done by choosing one structure out of possible ones).

**Semiotics:** In semiotics (study of signs and symbols), one might take a sign to consist of signifier and signified. Our binary $\delta$ could possibly be used to form a sign out of a signifier (as first part) and a signified (second part). Then $I_0$ might represent some primitive sign (maybe a pure form or pure content). Then an idea $\delta(S, C)$ would be a full sign with form $S$ and content $C$. The theory would then generate a whole system of signs. *Structural identity* would mean two signs are identical only if both their signifier and signified parts are identical (no two distinct signifiers with the same content collapse into one sign in our formal sense – they'd be two signs with maybe same meaning but different form, which is indeed how semiotics would treat synonyms: different signifiers, considered different signs despite same referent). So the formalism might model how layers of meaning compose. For example, one could attach connotations as further layers: $\delta(\text{Connotation}, \delta(\text{wordForm}, \text{concept}))$ as an idea structure meaning “the connotation attached to the sign 'wordForm–concept'.” Many such patterns could capture semiotic relationships.

### 6. Self-Referential Systems and Gödelian Phenomena

One fascinating application is in analyzing self-referential systems. Our theory can represent statements about statements (though it doesn't assign them truth). For example, consider Gödel numbering: in Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, one encodes statements as numbers to let statements refer to themselves. We could similarly encode each idea as a number via δ-complexity ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)). Then for any idea $X$, one can form an idea $Y$ that somehow asserts "X is not provable" by using the number of $X$ within a formal provability predicate pattern. Representing that fully would require expanding our formalism with logical predicates, but as a skeleton, we have the capability to place an idea’s own code inside itself or relate structures with their codes. That is a step toward representing **Gödel sentences**. The uniqueness of coding (injectivity) is crucial — it’s exactly Gödel’s condition that coding be unique and mechanizable ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)). Our δ-based complexity provides a unique code and is effectively computable (just count and assign indices). This means we have the raw material to import something like Gödel numbering scheme where each idea "knows" its number or we can construct an idea that contains the code of another (which is akin to Gödel’s diagonal lemma construction). 

While this is speculative, it indicates that our system, while simple, is rich enough to express the kind of self-reference at the heart of Gödel’s theorem, or Tarski’s undefinability theorem, etc., once augmented with the notion of a truth predicate or provability predicate as additional structure on top of $\mathcal{I}_4$. The benefit is that since each idea is uniquely identified by a number, we avoid issues of different expressions referring to the same statement — each statement (idea) is canonical, so self-reference can be pinpointed exactly.

One could even attempt an application in **metaprogramming** or **reflection** in computer science: languages that have reflective capabilities (able to manipulate their own code as data) often need to ensure the code has a representation accessible at runtime. Our idea-codes and idea-structures provide a uniform way to represent code within code. A Lisp program can quote itself; similarly, in our framework, an idea can incorporate a sub-idea that is basically a representation of another idea. Because everything is an idea, quoting is just using the same structure at a higher level. This might simplify designing reflective systems because you don't need a separate metalanguage — the object language is its own metalanguage to some extent (like Lisp homoiconicity). Our $I_0$ and $\delta$ are so general that an idea can encode an interpreter for the idea system itself (that's essentially what a Gödelian self-reference does). 

**Conclusion of Applications:** The formal theory we proposed might seem esoteric, but its implications and uses span many fields. The key strengths that enable these applications are:

- **Universality of form:** Everything is built from one operation, making it a convenient *universal format* for interchange or meta-representation.

- **Canonical representation:** Ideas have a unique structure, which aids in identity checking, merging of data, and eliminating ambiguity. This is especially useful in distributed systems, knowledge graphs, and any scenario where you need a single source of truth for a concept ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)).

- **Hierarchical construction:** The partial order by complexity provides a natural hierarchy (which can be used in learning sequences, ontology layering, etc.). It’s analogous to how more complex theorems in math build on simpler ones; here more complex ideas build on simpler ones.

- **Allowance of all combinations:** This maximizes creativity and completeness, as noted in AI brainstorming or theoretical search spaces. We don’t miss possibilities by imposing premature restrictions.

- **Simplicity of the formalism:** Only one kind of building block means implementations can be streamlined (one data type to handle, one recursion to optimize). It is language-agnostic; it could underlie very different semantic systems with the same structural engine.

Of course, when moving to practice, one would have to implement additional layers (for example, a type-checker on top, or a semantic evaluator, or domain-specific primitives akin to an expanding $I_0$ into many base symbols). But the core could remain the same, which suggests our theory might serve as a **unifying foundation** beneath disparate systems. Similar ambitions have been seen in projects like *universal knowledge representation languages* or *general logics*, and our approach is in that spirit but boiled down to the absolute minimalist core.

## Conclusion

We have presented a comprehensive development of a **formal theory of ideas** that begins from a single primitive and reaches a system of **minimal binary abstraction**. The journey went through four versions, each adding expressive power while preserving the central principle that **only structural form determines identity** and meaning is not hard-wired. We summarize the key accomplishments and insights of this work as follows:

- **Formal Framework:** We defined a rigorous formal system in which every idea is inductively generated from one primitive $I_0$ via the abstraction operation $\delta$. In Version 1 and 2 (unary abstractions), ideas are organized in a hierarchy akin to a tree of generalizations. In Version 3 (binary abstraction), we allowed ideas to be *combined*, treating one idea as a function or modifier of another. Finally, Version 4 distilled the system to its simplest ingredients: one constant and one binary constructor, with no further structure except that which emerges from their combinations.

- **Uniqueness of Abstraction Chains:** A fundamental theorem throughout was that each idea has a **unique abstraction chain/tree** leading back to the primitive (Theorems 1.1, 2.1, 3.1). This gives our theory a property of **unique decomposition** (no ambiguity in how an idea is built) and mirrors extensionality in set theory ([Axiom:Axiom of Extension - ProofWiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Axiom:Axiom_of_Extension#:~:text=The%20Axiom%20of%20Extension%20is,determined%20by%20its%20%205)). Conceptually, this means every idea can be seen as having a *unique definition* in terms of simpler ideas. This uniqueness was not assumed but proved from the injectivity of the abstraction operations ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)). It is a distinguishing feature compared to many semantic networks or type systems, where sometimes multiple derivations can lead to the same concept – our formal system avoids that by design.

- **δ-Based Complexity:** We introduced a measure of **complexity** for ideas based on the number and pattern of $\delta$ operations required to construct them. We proved that this δ-based complexity (essentially a Gödel-like encoding ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)) of the idea’s structure) is **injective**, i.e., it uniquely determines the idea’s structure (Corollaries 1.2, 2.2, 3.2). Practically, this gives each idea a sort of “fingerprint” or canonical name ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)). In applications, this can be used as a hash or unique ID for concepts. The injectivity relies on foundational mathematical facts like unique prime factorization and the properties of pairing functions ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=As%20an%20example%20for%20unique,displaystyle)), which we leveraged in our proofs.

- **Allowance of Conceptual Nonsense:** We explicitly *allow all syntactically well-formed ideas*, including those that might be considered meaningless or contradictory under some interpretation. This is not a bug but a feature: the theory does not enforce semantic constraints at the structural level. We justified that including "nonsensical" structures is harmless to the formal consistency (since no semantics means no formal contradiction can arise from them) and is in fact beneficial for **completeness** and **flexibility**. It means the theory’s universe of ideas is closed under the abstraction operation in the fullest sense – it’s an algebraic closure. We discussed how any semantic filtering (to rule out nonsense) can be applied *after* the fact, as an additional layer, without needing to mutilate the formal generative capacity. This design choice is aligned with practices in formal logic (e.g., the principle that syntax is independent of semantics, and one can study well-formed formulas even if they might be unsatisfiable or meaningless in some model).

- **Philosophical Alignment:** We examined how our formal theory connects to and illuminates various philosophical perspectives:
  - It embodies **structuralism** by making structure the sole criterion for identity and by deferring meaning to relations ([Untitled Document](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/NotesOnSaussure.html#:~:text=change,is%20subject%20both%20to%20history)).
  - It resonates with **constructivism** in that all ideas are built, not innate; it provides a clear constructive genesis for every concept.
  - It parallels **phenomenological bracketing** by focusing on the form of ideas (noema) rather than their external reference, and it allows intentional structures (with $\delta(F,X)$ viewed as an idea directed at $X$ under mode $F$).
  - It accommodates **post-structuralist insights** by acknowledging the endless deferral of semantic resolution and by including even disruptive elements (nonsense, self-reference) in the discourse rather than excluding them.
  
  We maintained an academically skeptical tone, avoiding unwarranted leaps. Every formal claim was supported by proof or reference to established results, and speculative interpretations were clearly delineated as such.

- **Applications and Utility:** We explored a range of potential applications:
  - In **knowledge representation**, our theory can serve as a backbone for unique concept identifiers and dependency graphs ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)).
  - In **type theory and programming languages**, it offers a universal untyped structure that can underlie typed systems or serve as a medium for generic programming.
  - For **cognitive science**, it provides a model for concept composition and a measure of conceptual complexity that could correlate with learnability or cognitive load.
  - In **logical foundations**, it provides a simple domain in which to encode self-referential statements or perform Gödel numbering ([Understanding Kolmogorov Complexity | Not a Number](https://not-a-number.io/2024/understanding-kolmogorov-complexity/#:~:text=Kolmogorov%20complexity%20is%20about%20the,uncomputability%20aspect%20of%20Kolmogorov%20complexity)), and its uniqueness property can simplify meta-logical arguments (no need to consider multiple representations of the same formula).
  - In **semantics and linguistics**, it gives a formal way to represent possible compound meanings and is analogous to parse trees or sign structures, with a clear separation of concerns between syntax (structure) and semantics (pattern-based interpretation).
  
  These applications demonstrate that the theory is not merely an abstract exercise; it has the potential to inform practical systems and cross-pollinate with other disciplines. The emphasis on canonical form and unique identifiers for ideas is especially timely in an era of distributed information systems and AI knowledge graphs where aligning concepts is a major challenge ([set theory - Question Regarding the Axiom of Extensionality - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/400004/question-regarding-the-axiom-of-extensionality#:~:text=,)).

- **Limitations and Future Work:** We are aware that our theory, by itself, does not solve the problem of **semantic equivalence** or **truth**. It intentionally sidesteps those, focusing on generative structure. Future research is needed to investigate how best to impose or learn semantic constraints on the $\mathcal{I}_4$ universe. One approach could be to define an interpretation function $I: \mathcal{I}_4 \to D$ into some domain of meanings and then characterize which ideas map to equivalent elements of $D$. Another approach is to extend the formal system with *types or predicates* that restrict $\delta$’s application in various contexts (essentially building typed or sorted versions of the theory). We deferred this to keep the core minimal, but it is a promising direction to obtain the *best of both worlds*: a universal idea representation plus the ability to carve out, say, a subalgebra of “well-typed ideas” that correspond to meaningful expressions in some domain. 

Another area for future work is exploring **variations of the abstraction operator**. We considered one binary operator. What if we introduced a second binary operator (say $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$) or made $\delta$ associative or commutative via axioms? That would radically change the structure (e.g., commutativity would identify $\delta(F,X)$ with $\delta(X,F)$, losing uniqueness unless additional bookkeeping is added). Our current stance is that adding algebraic identifications like commutativity would break uniqueness (two different trees could then represent the same equivalence class). So if one needs commutativity (for example, in an idea of an *unordered combination*), one should enforce it at semantic level or by sorting some substructures. These are design choices that depend on the application domain.

Finally, there is scope to implement this theory in a **software prototype** (perhaps as a knowledge base or theorem prover’s kernel) to test its practicality. Would the δ-codes be manageable in size? How would one perform pattern-driven semantic interpretation effectively? These engineering questions can be addressed with experiments. There is optimism that modern computing can handle surprisingly large symbolic structures and that hashing or interning techniques ([Term algebra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_algebra#:~:text=As%20an%20example%20for%20unique,displaystyle)) can mitigate the exponential blow-up for moderate depths by reusing shared sub-structures.

**Concluding Thoughts:** By reducing the theory of ideas to a single primitive and a single mode of combination, we have exposed the **essential skeleton** of conceptual structure. This skeleton, albeit abstract, is sturdy: it can carry the weight of complex thoughts without bending, because it carefully guarantees uniqueness and consistency at every joint (each abstraction step is invertible and distinct). In doing so, we have also avoided painting the skeleton with any particular color of semantics — that is left to future anatomists of meaning. As a result, the theory is *general*: it does not favor any particular domain of ideas (mathematical, physical, metaphysical, etc.), and it sets a neutral stage on which any semantic play can be performed, with the assurance that the underlying scaffolding will keep the actors (the ideas) well-organized and unambiguous.

In a way, this work is an argument that **the form of thought can be studied independently of its content**, and that such study yields dividends in clarity and organization. Just as algebra reveals structure common to many mathematical systems by stripping away specifics, our formal theory reveals a common structural core beneath how ideas can relate to each other. We have only one basic relation: "being an abstraction of / applied to". And yet, from that relation unfolds an infinite tapestry of possible constructs. By examining the properties of that relation (associativity, uniqueness, etc.), we derived a coherent picture of that tapestry.

To return to the title: *“Structure, Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive”* – we indeed found structure (a whole algebra of ideas), uniqueness (each idea one-of-a-kind by construction), and a measure of generative complexity (δ-length/encoding) all stemming from the simplest of beginnings. This suggests a philosophical point: **perhaps complexity in the realm of ideas does not require complex primitives, only powerful ways to combine**. A lone primitive with a binary nexus was sufficient to engender unlimited complexity. This echoes how a binary operation (like a NAND gate) is enough to build any computation in computer science ([Abstract nonsense - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense#:~:text=Roughly%20speaking%2C%20category%20theory%20is,53%20was%20critical%20of%20this)), or how two simple rules can generate a fractal of infinite detail. Our theory shows something analogous for the space of concepts.

In conclusion, we have not solved the mystery of meaning, but we have provided a stable formal platform on which that mystery can be explored. The **formal theory of ideas** laid out here is intended as a foundation — both a rigorous mathematical foundation (in the sense of providing a well-defined domain for reasoning about concepts) and a conceptual foundation (clarifying how complex ideas relate to simpler ones in principle). Future explorations will build upon this foundation, adding layers of interpretation, integrating it with empirical knowledge, and potentially refining the operations (for instance, introducing new primitives or quotienting by equivalences as needed). But the hope is that by having identified a **minimal, sound core**, all such extensions will be more principled and easier to manage, much as a clear skeleton aids the growth and adaptation of a living organism.

The paper combined formal development with philosophical and practical reflections, maintaining a rigorous approach throughout. By doing so, we aimed to satisfy both the **academic skeptic** (who demands clarity, proofs, and no hand-waving) and the **visionary** (who sees the big picture of how this could influence understanding of ideas in various fields). The end result is a theory that is at once **simple and far-reaching**. We invite others to test it, apply it, and even critique it — for in a truly structuralist spirit, it is through the network of differences (other theories, interpretations, implementations) that the significance of this theory of ideas will be fully realized.
