## Abstract

We present a formal model of scientific discovery grounded in the Interface Theory of Ideas, in which all knowledge is understood as recursive structure filtered through expressive modalities. In this framework, we generalize the scientific method as a series of interlinked **modal interfaces**—each representing a phase of cognition, hypothesis, evaluation, or memory. Each modality acts as a projection filter, mapping abstract structure to constrained forms and incurring domain-specific loss. We formalize this loop as a dynamic system of compositionally recursive projection and refinement. This perspective dissolves the traditional boundary between internal reasoning and external observation, allowing for a unified understanding of learning, theory formation, and conceptual evolution. The result is a minimal and extensible framework that abstracts both human and machine discovery into a shared modal architecture.

## 1. Introduction

Scientific discovery has long been modeled as a rational sequence: observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, revision. Yet such models assume a clear distinction between thought and perception, between inner models and external truth. In contrast, the Interface Theory treats **all knowledge as structure**, and **all cognition as projection through filters**—called **modalities**.

This paper extends that view. We propose that **each phase of scientific reasoning itself behaves like a modality**, complete with a domain of expression, a loss function, and an interface to structured ideas. What emerges is a recursive system of knowledge generation that can be analyzed, manipulated, and generalized in a formal setting.

We begin by restating the minimal Interface Theory of Ideas. We then define modalities and loss-aware projection. From there, we generalize the scientific loop—showing that **generation, projection, feedback, refinement, and memory** can all be modeled as modal interfaces. Finally, we analyze the implications for learning, abstraction, and the foundations of discovery.

## 2. The Interface Theory of Ideas

Let \( \mathcal{I} \) be the space of all ideas, generated recursively as:

- \( \pi \in \mathcal{I} \): the primitive idea  
- \( A : \mathcal{I} \times \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{I} \): binary abstraction operator  
- If \( i_1, i_2 \in \mathcal{I} \), then \( A(i_1, i_2) \in \mathcal{I} \)

Each idea is a finite, well-founded abstraction tree rooted in \( \pi \).  
Structure is the only criterion of identity: two ideas are equal iff their construction paths are identical.

This system admits no intrinsic semantics—only **structural form**.

### 2.1 Modalities and Expression

Let \( \mathcal{M} \) be the space of all **modalities**, where each modality \( m \in \mathcal{M} \) is defined by a pair:

- \( E_m : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{R}_m \cup \{ \mathbf{0}_m \} \): expression function  
- \( L_m : \mathcal{I} \to \mathbb{R}^+ \cup \{\infty\} \): loss function  

where:

- \( \mathcal{R}_m \) is the range of possible expressions in modality \( m \)  
- \( \mathbf{0}_m \) is the null expression (i.e., unexpressible in \( m \))  
- \( L_m(i) \) is the degree of structure lost under projection

Ideas are not always expressible in every modality. The ability to be tested, remembered, or refined depends on **which filters an idea can pass through** and **how much of it survives**.
