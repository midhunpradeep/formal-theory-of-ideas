<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>We propose a rigorous scientific-philosophical framework that
reconceives <strong>scientific discovery</strong> not as a linear
sequence of methods, but as a <strong>recursive traversal across
multiple modal interfaces</strong> of knowledge. Building on the
<em>Interface Theory of Ideas</em> and a <em>Formal Theory of
Ideas</em>, we formalize how observation, hypothesis, experimentation,
evaluation, and memory can be viewed as <strong>equivalent modal
projections</strong> within a unified system. Each stage of inquiry is
modeled as an <strong>interface transformation</strong>: a mapping that
imposes its own structure and attendant <strong>loss</strong> of
information on the content it processes. We introduce a minimal formal
vocabulary – including a fundamental <strong>primitive idea</strong>
<span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>, an <strong>abstraction
operator</strong> <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>,
<strong>modal projection</strong> functions for different modes of
inquiry, and associated <strong>loss functions</strong> – to describe
how complex ideas (e.g. scientific theories) emerge from simpler ones
and are continually refined. The process of discovery becomes a
<em>recursive loop</em>: ideas are generated and expressed in various
modalities, filtered and partially lost in translation, then
re-integrated and elevated through further abstraction. This monograph
is aimed at an interdisciplinary audience spanning philosophy of
science, cognitive science, AI theory, and epistemology. We maintain
formal rigor (with definitions, equations, and if needed, theorems)
alongside a poetical interpretive tone. Metaphors and analogies are used
throughout to <strong>intuitively illuminate abstract notions</strong>.
In the end, we discuss profound implications of this model for the
nature of knowledge, meaning, reality, and scientific objectivity –
suggesting that what we call “objective reality” may itself be the limit
of an iterative interface process, forever filtering and projecting, yet
gradually converging toward an <strong>ever-elusive truth</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>What does it mean to <strong>“discover”</strong> something
scientifically? Classical views of the scientific method outline a
series of discrete steps – observe, hypothesize, predict, test, conclude
– as if scientific discovery were a procedural checklist. In contrast,
recent perspectives in cognitive science and philosophy suggest a more
fluid interplay: our <strong>perceptions and concepts</strong> mediate
any access to reality (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Human%20knowledge%20and%20experience%20are,full%20complexity%20of%20the%20world">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=The%20Interface%20Theory%20of%20Ideas,frames%20our%20sense%20of%20reality">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). In this monograph, we advance the idea
that <strong>scientific discovery is not a simple sequence of
procedures, but a recursive traversal across modal filters of
understanding</strong>. In other words, each so-called “step”
(observation, theorization, experimentation, etc.) is actually an
instance of a common underlying operation: the <strong>modal
projection</strong> of <em>ideas</em> from one representational mode to
another. By <em>modal</em> we mean tied to a particular form or mode of
representation – for example, the sensory modality of observation or the
symbolic modality of theory. By <em>projection</em> we mean a mapping or
translation of content into that mode, much like casting a
multi-dimensional object onto a lower-dimensional screen, inevitably
losing some detail in the process.</p>
<p>Our approach builds on two theoretical pillars developed previously:
an <strong>Interface Theory of Ideas</strong>, which posits that what we
experience as reality is an interface of ideas rather than a direct
window onto the world (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=The%20Interface%20Theory%20of%20Ideas,frames%20our%20sense%20of%20reality">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>); and a <strong>Formal Theory of
Ideas</strong>, which constructs a rigorous algebraic system for idea
generation from a single primitive. Using these foundations, we will
treat <em>scientific cognition</em> itself as an <em>interface
system</em>. <strong>Observations</strong>, <strong>hypotheses</strong>,
<strong>mathematical models</strong>, <strong>experimental
data</strong>, and <strong>memory records</strong> will all be viewed as
<strong>ideas expressed through different interfaces</strong>. The act
of observing through a microscope, formulating a hypothesis, or
interpreting a graph are, in our account, structurally similar
processes: each is an <strong>idea undergoing a modal
transformation</strong> – being filtered, compressed, or expanded
according to the constraints of a given modality.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, consider a simple analogy: <em>scientific
inquiry as exploring a multi-faceted landscape with different
tools</em>. In one phase you shine the light of observation,
illuminating some features while leaving others in darkness. In the
next, you put on the lens of theory, which brings certain patterns into
sharp focus while blurring out raw details. Later, you use the
instrument of experimentation, which chisels reality in a controlled
way, isolating a facet for inspection but possibly altering it in the
process. Finally, you archive what you learned in memory or in
literature, akin to sketching a map that captures the essentials but
cannot contain the full richness of the terrain. At each stage,
something is <strong>gained</strong> – a structure, a generalization, a
clarified signal – and something is <strong>lost</strong> – nuances,
anomalies, the unfiltered complexity. <strong>Scientific discovery
unfolds in the recursive cycling through these modes</strong>, each pass
refining the “map” while acknowledging it is never the full
“territory.”</p>
<p>In what follows, we develop a formal model of this recursive
multi-modal process. We begin by laying out the <strong>formal
foundations</strong>: the notion of a <em>primitive idea</em> and how
more complex ideas are built via an <em>abstraction operator</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. We then incorporate <strong>modal
interfaces</strong>: formal projection functions that correspond to
distinct modalities (observation, conceptualization, etc.), each with an
inherent <strong>structural loss</strong> (filtering). With these tools,
we construct an idealized <strong>cycle of discovery</strong> in formal
terms, showing how an initial raw observation can climb upward into
abstract theory and loop back down into predicted observation, in
principle ad infinitum. Throughout, we maintain a dual perspective:
<em>formally</em>, this is a system of sets, functions, and
compositional operations; <em>philosophically</em>, it is a story about
<strong>knowledge as a self-curating interface</strong>. We will
interweave rigorous definitions with intuitive metaphors, aiming to keep
the exposition accessible to readers from diverse disciplines while not
shying away from technical precision.</p>
<p>By reinterpreting scientific discovery as <strong>recursive modal
projection</strong>, we hope to illuminate perennial questions in
epistemology and philosophy of science. How do <strong>our observations
relate to reality</strong>? (We will suggest they are <em>interface
outputs</em> shaped by survival and sensorimotor constraints rather than
mirrors of truth.) How do <strong>theories attain meaning</strong>? (We
will argue meaning arises from their place in a <strong>network of ideas
and projections</strong>, not in isolation.) What makes scientific
knowledge seemingly <strong>objective</strong> and yet subject to
change? (Our answer will point to the way iterative cross-modal checking
– projections and back-projections – yields stable invariant structures
that we mistake for an independent reality, even as the interface can
evolve.) In the end, this exercise is both humbling and empowering:
humbling, because it underscores the filters between us and any final
Reality; empowering, because it shows how far we can go by cleverly
<strong>traversing those filters</strong>. The concluding sections will
reflect on these implications, suggesting that scientific objectivity,
meaning, and reality itself can be understood as emergent properties of
a <strong>projective, recursive epistemic interface</strong> rather than
pregiven absolutes.</p>

Foundations: Ideas, Abstraction, and Modal Interfaces</h2>
<p>Before examining the full scientific cycle, we need a formal language
for talking about <strong>ideas</strong> and their <strong>modal
expressions</strong>. We adopt a minimalist foundational ontology:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Primitive Idea (<span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>):</strong> We assume there is at
least one <strong>primitive idea</strong>, denoted <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>, which serves as the most basic
building block of thought. You can think of <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> as an <strong>“ur-idea”</strong>,
an undefined atomic unit of cognition (analogous to an empty set in set
theory or a foundational atom in a formal system) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L118%20assume%20the,the%20abstraction%20mechanism%20to%20increase">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). In
practice, there may be many primitive ideas (for example, distinct
sensory primitives like a basic color or sound); we denote the set of
all primitive ideas as <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>. For
much of our formal development, however, we can simplify to a single
abstract primitive <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em> ∈ <em>P</em></span> without loss of
generality, since multiple primitives can be encoded as abstractions of
a single one (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=generative%20basis%20to%20the%20minimum,example%2C%20if%20in%20Version%202">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>).
Importantly, <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> carries <em>no
inherent meaning</em> – it is a placeholder from which meaning will be
constructed by structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universe of Ideas (<span
class="math inline">ℐ</span>):</strong> From primitive <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> (or primitives in <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>) we build up a potentially
infinite set <span class="math inline">ℐ</span> of all <strong>possible
ideas</strong>. An <strong>idea</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> ∈ ℐ</span> is understood not by any
intrinsic semantic content but by its <strong>structural
relationships</strong> to other ideas. In other words, each idea has a
kind of “construction history” (or abstraction tree) that ultimately
traces back to primitive elements (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20structure%20of,a%20unique%20primitive%20via%20abstraction">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Our%20theory%20embodies%20the%20structuralist,is%20entirely%20defined%20by%20how">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). Two
ideas are considered identical <em>if and only if</em> their
construction histories (their structural form) are identical (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=with%20formal%20axioms%2C%20definitions%2C%20and,semantically%20meaningless%20combinations%20%E2%80%93%20as">A

href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=This%20structuralist%20stance%20solves%20one,In%20linguistics%2C%20the">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). This
is our criterion of <strong>structural identity</strong>. It means, for
example, that an idea like “electron” in one scientist’s mind could be
different from “electron” in another’s mind if they were built via
different conceptual routes – a provocative notion that formalizes why
experts may <em>conceptualize</em> the “same” thing differently based on
their training and experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abstraction Operator (<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>):</strong> To generate complex
ideas from simpler ones, we employ an <strong>abstraction
operator</strong> <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. Formally,
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> can be thought of as an
operation that takes one or more existing ideas and <strong>composes or
generalizes</strong> them into a new idea. In the simplest case, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> might be a unary operator (taking
a single idea to a higher-level idea), but in general we allow <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to act on a <em>set</em> of ideas:
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em> : 𝒫(ℐ) → ℐ</span>, where <span
class="math inline">𝒫(ℐ)</span> denotes the power set of <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> (all subsets of ideas). For a collection of
ideas <span
class="math inline">{<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>i</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>i</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>} ⊂ ℐ</span>,
we write <span
class="math display"><em>j</em> = <em>A</em>({<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>,…,<em>i</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>})</span>
to mean <span class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> is a new idea
abstracted from <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>i</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>i</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>.
Intuitively, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>
<strong>forgets</strong> the individuating details of its input ideas
and retains what is common or structurally salient among them (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=This%20abstraction%20process%20allows%20the,and%20more%20of%20a%20generalized">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20to%20note,In%20formula%3A%20%E2%84%90">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). In cognitive terms, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> might take several specific
observations and yield a general concept. For example, from many
observed apple instances, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>
might produce the idea <em>apple (in general)</em>; from diverse data
points, a scientist’s mind applies <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> to extract a law or pattern.</p>
<p>The abstraction operator can be applied repeatedly and in various
combinations. Because we view all ideas as ultimately composed of
primitives, one can imagine building up an <strong>abstraction
tree</strong> or network: starting from <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> (or elements of <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>) at the base, an idea <span
class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> may be <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>-constructed from some prior ideas,
which in turn were <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>-constructed from others, and so
on, until you bottom out at primitives. The set <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> is thus the <strong>closure</strong> of
<span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> under <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> (and any other operations we later
introduce) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=similarities%2C%20yielding%20an%20efficient%20summary,one%20or%20more%20primitive%20ideas">The

class="math inline">ℐ = Cl (<em>P</em>∣<em>A</em>)</span>, the smallest
set containing all primitives that is closed under application of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>. Every complex idea <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> ∈ ℐ</span> can be traced back through a
unique sequence of abstractions to one or more primitive ideas (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=with%20formal%20axioms%2C%20definitions%2C%20and,semantically%20meaningless%20combinations%20%E2%80%93%20as">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). This
guarantees a form of <strong>uniqueness</strong>: each idea has a
<strong>canonical construction</strong> (no idea can be constructed in
two distinct ways under our formal rules (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=,from%20exactly%20one%20prior%20idea">A

Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>)),
which in turn means we can assign each idea a unique “code” or
<em>complexity measure</em> based on its construction steps (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=no%20additional%20identifications%20%28i,to%20be%20confused%20with%20the">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). We
will not digress into the proof here, but conceptually, think of it like
Gödel numbering in mathematics: you could encode the abstraction history
of an idea as a unique number or string (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=on%20the%20number%20of%20abstraction,the%20first%20version%20in%20which">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). This
will be important when we discuss tracking ideas through transformations
– it ensures we don’t confuse one idea for another, even when modalities
blur their appearances.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modalities and Interfaces:</strong> While <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> describes how ideas combine and
generalize <em>internally</em>, <strong>modal interfaces</strong>
describe how ideas are <strong>expressed or experienced</strong> in
various forms. A <em>modality</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> can be anything like a sensory
channel (vision, hearing), a representational format (e.g. verbal
language, mathematics), or a cognitive context (e.g. memory vs immediate
experience). Each modality <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>
comes equipped with an <strong>expression function</strong> (or
<strong>projection function</strong>) <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> that
<strong>projects an idea into the format of that modality</strong> (<a

class="math inline"><em>i</em> ∈ ℐ</span> is an idea, then <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em>)</span>
is the <em>manifestation</em> or <em>projection</em> of that idea in
modality <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. For example, if
<span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> is the idea of a
mathematical relationship (say, the law of gravitation), <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub>math</sub>(<em>i</em>)</span> might
be a specific equation written on paper, whereas <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub>visual</sub>(<em>i</em>)</span> might
be a graph or a mental image illustrating that law, and <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub>verbal</sub>(<em>i</em>)</span> could
be a spoken description. All these are different <strong>modal
projections</strong> of the same underlying idea <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>.</p>
<p>Crucially, each <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> is in general
<strong>many-to-one</strong> or non-injective (<a

Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). This means that <strong>modal
expressions are lossy</strong>: many distinct ideas may cast the
<em>same</em> shadow on a given interface. In modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, the ideas <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub>2</sub></span> could <strong>collapse
to an indistinguishable expression</strong>, if <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>) = <em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>)</span>
even though <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub>1</sub> ≠ <em>i</em><sub>2</sub></span>
as ideas (<a

Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). Equivalently, <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> <em>filters
out</em> certain differences – it imposes a structure that can’t capture
all the richness of <span class="math inline">ℐ</span>. We call this
<strong>structural filtering</strong>, and we will often speak of the
<strong>structural loss</strong> of modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. The loss can be thought of as
information that gets left behind when an idea is squeezed through the
constraints of a particular medium of expression (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20our%20visual%20modality,to%20an%20acoustic%20sequence%20that">The

Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). For instance, our visual modality (<span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> = vision</span>) is sensitive to shapes
and colors but not to the molecular details of objects (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20our%20visual%20modality,to%20an%20acoustic%20sequence%20that">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). Two different molecular configurations
can look identical (thus map to the same <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub>vision</sub></span>), meaning the
vision interface loses the information that could have distinguished
them. Likewise, a theory might predict two different underlying
mechanisms that nevertheless produce the same observable outcome; an
experiment might not be able to tell which mechanism is at work because
its measurements are too coarse – again a case of different ideas
mapping to the same modal output.</p>
<p>Every modality has its own <em>logic</em> of what it preserves and
what it discards. We may formalize a notion of <strong>loss
function</strong> for each modality: for example, we can define a
non-negative loss <span
class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>)</span>
such that <span
class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>) = 0</span>
if <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>) = <em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>)</span>
(i.e. <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> fails to distinguish
<span class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub>1</sub></span> from <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub>2</sub></span>) and <span
class="math inline"><em>Λ</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>) &gt; 0</span>
otherwise. In simpler terms, if a modality conflates two ideas, it has
lost the distinction between them. Often we are interested in the loss
between an idea and itself under projection: we might write <span
class="math inline">ℓ<sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em>) = <em>I</em>(<em>i</em>) − <em>I</em>(<em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em>))</span>
metaphorically, where <span class="math inline"><em>I</em>(⋅)</span> is
some measure of information content or complexity. This expresses that
the <em>idea</em> <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> lives in a
higher-dimensional space of structure, and its <em>expression</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em>)</span>
lives in a lower-dimensional (or otherwise restricted) space <span
class="math inline">ℰ<sub><em>m</em></sub></span>. We will not need to
pick a specific numerical measure, but conceptually <span
class="math inline">ℓ<sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>i</em>)</span> indicates
how much of <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>’s structure is
<em>invisible</em> or flattened out to modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With these components – primitive ideas, abstraction <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, and modal projection <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> – we have a
kind of <strong>language for epistemic interfaces</strong>. We can now
begin to describe the scientific discovery process in this language,
treating each phase of inquiry as a particular configuration of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> operations.
To foreshadow: observation will correspond to applying an <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> that goes
from the world to internal ideas; hypothesis generation will correspond
to using <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> on accumulated
ideas; prediction will use an <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> in reverse
(projecting an idea back into a modality of expected data); evaluation
will involve comparing expressions (possibly via another specialized
interface function); and memory will involve storing ideas in a
resilient form (another modality with its own properties). All these
will be seen as <strong>instances of the same structural
template</strong>: <em>take an idea (or ideas), project via some
mapping, incur some loss, produce a new idea or record</em>. The power
of science arises not from escaping these losses, but from
<strong>chaining and cycling the operations</strong> such that the
losses in one mode can be compensated or checked by insights from
another, gradually zeroing in on invariant structures that withstand
modal translation.</p>
<h2 id="modal-interfaces-in-scientific-discovery">Modal Interfaces in
Scientific Discovery</h2>
<p>Let us delineate the key <strong>modal interfaces</strong> involved
in the scientific discovery loop and define them in our formal terms. We
identify at least four fundamental interfaces at play:
<strong>Observation</strong>, <strong>Hypothesis
(Conceptualization)</strong>, <strong>Experiment/Evaluation</strong>,
and <strong>Memory</strong>. Each of these can be rigorously described
as a mapping (or set of mappings) between different domains of
information, each mapping being <strong>modal</strong> (i.e. having
specific structural constraints and losses). By viewing them side by
side, we will see that they are structurally analogous – in essence,
<em>each is an interface filtering reality in a particular way</em>.
This justifies treating them as equivalent types of operations in the
larger recursive system. We discuss each in turn:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Observational Interface (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span>):</strong>
This interface connects the external <strong>world of phenomena</strong>
to the internal world of ideas via our senses or instruments. Formally,
we can define a domain <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> to
represent states of the world (or relevant aspects of reality under
study). The observational modality <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em></span> has an associated projection <span
class="math display"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub> : <em>W</em> → ℐ<sub>obs</sub>,</span>
where <span class="math inline">ℐ<sub>obs</sub> ⊆ ℐ</span> is the subset
of ideas that count as <em>observational ideas</em> or
<em>percepts</em>. In practice, <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> might be
broken into multiple sub-modalities (vision, hearing, experimental
apparatus readings, etc.), but we can abstractly treat it as one
combined interface from “world to mind.” When a scientist makes an
observation – e.g. measuring the temperature of a gas, or noting the
color of a reaction – the function <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> is at
work.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Loss:</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> is inherently
a <strong>partial and lossy function</strong>. The world <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> contains an unfathomable richness
of detail (one might say infinite degrees of freedom at the quantum
level, for instance), but the observation interface captures only a
finite, focused slice. Each act of observation is like taking a
high-dimensional reality and letting it shine through a tiny keyhole:
only certain aspects pass through. The size and shape of that keyhole
are determined by our sensory apparatus or instruments. For example, the
human eye (one component of <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span>) captures a
two-dimensional projection of the 3D world, sensitive to electromagnetic
waves in only a narrow band (visible light) – that is a huge structural
filtering. A thermometer reading gives one number (mean kinetic energy
of particles mapped to degrees), collapsing the myriad motions of
molecules into a single scalar. We might formalize a <strong>measurement
idea</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>)</span>
for some world state <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em> ∈ <em>W</em></span>. Different world
states could yield the same observation <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> (many microstates give the same
temperature reading) – thus <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>)</span>
discards the micro-details. In terms of our loss notation, <span
class="math inline">ℓ<sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>)</span> would be
large in general; <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> preserves
just those aspects of reality that are relevant to the question or that
our modality is designed to detect, and <em>nothing more</em>.</p>
<p>Despite this loss, the observational interface provides the
<strong>grounding</strong> for science. It delivers empirical content –
<strong>facts</strong> – that subsequent interfaces will attempt to
explain or use. One can say <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> yields the
“raw data” (though even raw data is already cooked by the interface). It
is important to remember that even at this first stage, <em>what we call
data is an idea in the mind of the observer or the record of an
instrument, not reality in full</em>. Observation is <strong>the world’s
idea as rendered to us</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conceptual/Hypothesis Interface (<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>):</strong>
From observations and prior knowledge, scientists generate
<strong>hypotheses</strong> or conceptual models. This is the interface
of <strong>conceptual abstraction and combination</strong>, which we can
identify with our abstraction operator <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> acting over a set of idea inputs.
Let’s denote by <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> the modality
of conceptual thought (high-level reasoning, theory-space). While
conceptual thought is not separate from the mind (indeed all of this is
in the mind), we treat it as a distinct mode because it operates on
ideas <em>internally</em> rather than taking direct input from <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>. The hypothesis-generation step
can be modeled as an abstraction operator <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> which might
take a collection of observational ideas and possibly some memory ideas
(past knowledge) as input, yielding a new idea: <span
class="math display"><em>h</em> = <em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub>({<em>i</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>i</em><sub>2</sub>,…,<em>i</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>}),</span>
where each <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> ∈ ℐ</span> might
include recent observations or existing concepts, and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> ∈ ℐ<sub><em>H</em></sub></span> is a new
<strong>hypothesis idea</strong> in the conceptual modality <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>. Here <span
class="math inline">ℐ<sub><em>H</em></sub></span> refers to ideas
playing the role of theories or models. In many cases, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> is a
<strong>generalizing abstraction</strong>: it searches for a pattern
that might explain or unify the given pieces of information (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=This%20abstraction%20process%20allows%20the,and%20more%20of%20a%20generalized">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). For example, from observing that “this
object falls” and “that object falls,” etc., and recalling knowledge of
previous falling objects, one might abstract the idea of a force pulling
things down (a hypothesis of gravity). In practice, hypothesis
generation also involves creativity, analogy, and sometimes random
inspiration – those can be seen as different implementations or
stochastic elements within the operator <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>, which our
formalism doesn’t detail but can accommodate by treating some inputs as
coming from imaginative leaps (ultimately still ideas being
combined).</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Loss:</strong> The hypothesis interface <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> is where
<strong>induction and abduction</strong> occur, and it introduces its
own filters. When we abstract, we <strong>lose</strong> specifics to
gain generality (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=By%20building%20up%20ideas%20through,primitive%20ideas%20and%20the%20abstraction">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> might drop
contextual details that seem irrelevant in order to capture an
underlying rule. This is a kind of <em>information compression</em>:
many individual data points become one conceptual idea. The
<strong>structural loss here is the loss of particularity</strong>. A
hypothesis that all swans are white deliberately ignores the individual
distinctiveness of each observed swan and focuses only on the color
attribute across instances. In so doing, it might also ignore exceptions
or additional conditions. In formal terms, <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> = <em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub>({<em>i</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>})</span>
cannot be reversed without ambiguity: from the hypothesis alone, one
cannot reconstruct exactly which observations (or how many) led to it.
Many different sets of observations could lead to the same abstract idea
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>. Thus, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> (like any
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>) is many-to-one; it
sacrifices the <em>data-to-idea mapping</em> invertibility. However,
this loss is useful: it yields <strong>meaningful structure</strong> –
an educated guess or a rule that can now be tested and applied beyond
the original cases. Hypothesis ideas often introduce <em>new terms or
entities</em> (like “gravity” or “gene”) that go beyond direct
observation; they enrich the idea space <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> by adding <em>constructive elements</em>
not present in any single earlier idea.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> may operate
not just on observational inputs but also on <strong>other
hypotheses</strong>. Scientific theories often build on sub-theories:
e.g. a grand unifying theory might abstract from several mid-level
theories. This means the conceptual interface is recursive: ideas about
ideas are formed (consistent with our earlier discussion of recursion
and self-reference in idea systems (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=abstract%20idea%20can%20itself%20serve,in%20reflective%20thought%20and%20consciousness">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Now%2C%20beyond%20abstraction%2C%20consider%20ideas,body%20sensations%2C%20memories%2C%20and%20thoughts">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>)). We might have <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub>({<em>h</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>h</em><sub>2</sub>}) = <em>H</em><sub>12</sub></span>,
combining two earlier hypothesis ideas into a broader one. The
<strong>uniqueness</strong> of structural composition ensures that even
very complex theoretical structures can, in principle, be unraveled back
into their originating components, giving a clear lineage of thought for
those who trace it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Predictive/Experimental Interface (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span>):</strong>
Once a hypothesis (theory) is in hand, science proceeds to
<strong>derive predictions and test them</strong>. This involves a
perhaps subtle point in our formalism: a theory or hypothesis is an
idea, but to compare it with observations, it must be <strong>projected
into the modality of observation or experiment</strong>. We can think of
two linked interfaces here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>predictive projection</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub> : ℐ<sub><em>H</em></sub> → ℐ<sub>obs</sub></span>
that takes a hypothesis idea <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>
and generates an <em>expected observation idea</em> or pattern <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>)</span>.
In effect, this is using the theory to <strong>simulate</strong> or
predict what one should observe under given conditions. For example,
from a hypothesis about gravity, we predict “if I drop a 1 kg stone from
10m, I will observe it hit the ground in ~1.4 seconds.” The predicted
outcome (1.4 s free-fall time) is an idea in the observational format (a
measurable time).</li>
<li>An <strong>experimental execution</strong> interface <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span> that maps the
theory into an actual experimental setup or procedure in the world (one
could consider this a part of <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>, but it’s
useful to separate the <em>ideal prediction</em> from the <em>practical
action</em>). <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span> would involve
designing an experiment such that, if the world behaves according to
theory <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>, then running this
experiment in world <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> will
produce a certain observation. In a sense, <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span> is the
inverse of <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span>: it goes from
an idea to a deliberate intervention in <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>. However, for our purposes, we can
simplify and focus on the prediction vs. observation comparison, so we
will often merge the notion of experiment into the prediction interface.
We’ll use <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>)</span>
to denote the <em>set of expected observational outcomes</em> that
theory <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> implies (possibly
under a specific chosen experiment context).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure and Loss:</strong> The predictive interface <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> is another
projection with constraints. Even a theory has limits to what it can
predict – typically it gives us a functional relationship or a general
qualitative outcome, not a complete description of every aspect of the
phenomenon. <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>)</span>
might only cover the variables of interest that <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> addresses, ignoring others. For
instance, a physics theory might predict positions and velocities but
say nothing about color or sound, effectively filtering out those
aspects. Moreover, deriving <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>)</span>
often requires <strong>approximations or auxiliary assumptions</strong>,
which introduce further loss or distortion: one might assume “ideal
conditions” (vacuum, no friction, etc.) to get a clear prediction. These
idealizations are themselves a structural loss – the predicted idea
<span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is for an ideal scenario,
whereas any real observation <span class="math inline"><em>o</em></span>
will have additional noise or factors. We can formalize an idealization
as a restricted function <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>;<em>c</em>)</span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> encodes conditions
(some possibly untrue in reality), and thus the true predictive power of
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> in real condition <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em>’</span> might be <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em>′ = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>;<em>c</em>′)</span>
which could differ from <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>;<em>c</em>)</span>.
If the scientist neglects this difference, there is an implicit loss of
fidelity.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the predictive interface provides the crucial
<strong>bridge for testability</strong>. It transforms a hypothesis from
a floating idea into something that can be directly checked against
empirical reality via the observational interface. We have now two ideas
to compare: the <strong>predicted idea</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>)</span>
and the <strong>actual observed idea</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>)</span>
from performing the experiment on the world. Both <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> live in the same modality
(observational data space) and thus are comparable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation/Comparison Interface (<span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>):</strong> Science demands that we
<strong>close the loop</strong> by comparing what is predicted with what
is observed. This yields a judgement: did our idea survive the test, or
must it be modified or discarded? In our framework, this comparison is
itself an interface – a highly processed and simplified interpretation
of the relationship between two complex data sets. We define an
interface (or simply a function) <span
class="math display"><em>C</em> : ℐ<sub>obs</sub> × ℐ<sub>obs</sub> → ℐ<sub>eval</sub>,</span>
where <span class="math inline">ℐ<sub>eval</sub></span> might be a small
set of possible <strong>evaluation outcomes</strong> (e.g. “match”,
“mismatch”, or perhaps a numerical error measure idea). Given <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>)</span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em> = <em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>)</span>,
the evaluation interface produces <span
class="math display"><em>e</em> = <em>C</em>(<em>p</em>,<em>o</em>),</span>
an idea encapsulating the result of the test. For example, <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> might output a Boolean-like idea
(pass/fail), or a descriptive idea like “discrepancy in high-frequency
range”, or a statistical value like a <span
class="math inline"><em>χ</em><sup>2</sup></span> statistic encoded as
an idea. In any case, <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> is the
<strong>feedback</strong> that will inform what happens to our
hypothesis next.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Loss:</strong> At first glance, one might not
think of comparison as “lossy,” but consider that often a rich dataset
is reduced to a single <strong>p-value</strong>, or a complicated
pattern difference is summarized as “significant” or “not significant”.
This is a massive compression of information. The evaluation interface
<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> acts as a filter that
highlights only the <strong>discrepancies or accords</strong> relevant
to the hypothesis’s validity. It ignores <em>everything about the data
except how they differ or agree</em>. In formal terms, <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em>(<em>p</em>,<em>o</em>)</span> might be as
simple as <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em> = (|<em>p</em>−<em>o</em>|&lt;<em>ϵ</em>)</span>
(an idea representing a truth value of whether the difference is below
some threshold <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>). Much like
other modalities, different pairs <span
class="math inline">(<em>p</em>,<em>o</em>)</span> could yield the same
evaluation <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> – many different
mismatches might all map to “fail”, for instance. Thus, the
<strong>survival criterion</strong> in science is coarse-grained: we
typically do not retain all the information about <em>how</em> a theory
failed at this stage, just the essential verdict. Of course, scientists
do pay attention to detailed residuals and patterns (which effectively
means they sometimes use a richer <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> interface, breaking one comparison
into many smaller ones), but ultimately the outcome gets distilled into
an update to our belief in the hypothesis.</p>
<p>The notion of <strong>survivability</strong> can be introduced here.
We say an idea (hypothesis) <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>
<em>survives</em> a test if <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em> = <em>C</em>(<em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>),<em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>))</span>
indicates an acceptable match. Over the course of multiple recursive
cycles, a hypothesis might undergo many tests. We can define a measure
of survivability <span class="math inline"><em>S</em>(<em>h</em>)</span>
as the proportion of tests (weighted by importance) in which <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> passes, or perhaps as the
conditional probability of <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>
not being falsified given all evidence so far. In evolutionary terms,
hypotheses are like organisms facing an environment of experiments:
those that consistently yield <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> outputs indicating success will
<em>persist in the scientific record</em>, while those that don’t will
be <em>selected out</em>. This evolutionary analogy is not coincidental:
as the Interface Theory of Ideas suggests, our interfaces (including
cognitive ones) are themselves shaped by natural selection to favor
useful survivable patterns (<a

Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). In science, we impose an artificial
selection via rigorous testing, ensuring that only theories that
<strong>adapt</strong> (by being modified) or are inherently
<strong>fit</strong> (accurate) remain in play.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory/Recording Interface (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub></span>):</strong>
The final (though ongoing) interface we note is that of <strong>memory
and communication</strong>. Scientific discovery is cumulative:
observations and theories from one iteration must be
<strong>stored</strong> and made available for future cycles, often by
recording in notebooks, journals, or in one’s own long-term memory.
Memory itself can be viewed as a modality <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> with an encoding function <span
class="math display"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub> : ℐ → ℐ<sub><em>M</em></sub>,</span>
where <span class="math inline">ℐ<sub><em>M</em></sub></span> is the set
of <strong>memory traces</strong> or stored representations. For a human
scientist, <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub></span> might be the
act of committing something to memory (neural patterns) or writing it
down (the idea is now encoded in text, which is an idea in a linguistic
modality, and stored in a library or disk). For our purposes, the key is
that memory preserves ideas <strong>with some fidelity but also with
some loss</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Structure and Loss:</strong> Memory is imperfect. Human
memory will forget details or distort them over time; written records
omit the tacit knowledge or the full context of discovery. Thus <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub></span> is not a
trivial identity function. It filters and compresses information for
storage. One might only record the final results of an experiment and
not the numerous trials that led to it, for example. Or one might store
a simplified model and disregard edge cases that were observed. Memory
also has limited capacity and resolution, much like perception does.
However, memory’s strength is that it <strong>extends the interface
across time</strong>: what was once an immediate idea can later
resurface and be fed as input into a new abstraction (<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>) along with
new observations. In formal terms, after memory interface, the next
cycle’s hypothesis might be <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>′ = <em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub>({new
observation <em>i</em><sub>new</sub>,old stored idea
<em>i</em><sub>old</sub>})</span>. Memory ensures that knowledge
accumulates rather than each cycle starting from scratch. It effectively
<strong>couples the cycles of the recursion</strong>, threading them
into a coherent long-term inquiry.</p>
<p>We should note that communication to other scientists is another
aspect of <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub></span> –
effectively, publishing a paper is like writing to a <strong>shared
memory</strong> accessible by all in the community. This allows the
recursive process to become <strong>distributed across many
agents</strong> (the community of scientists) and across generations.
The framework can be expanded to multiple agents, each with their own
interfaces, communicating their ideas (which is an <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub></span> from one to
an input of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> for another,
and so on). For simplicity, we stick to a single inquirer abstraction,
but the power of science in reality comes from this collective recursion
with shared memory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These interfaces – Observation (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span>),
Hypothesis/Conceptualization (<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>),
Prediction/Experiment (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span>), Evaluation
(<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>), and Memory (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>M</em></sub></span>) – constitute
the <strong>modalities of scientific discovery</strong>. Each is an
<strong>idea-transformer</strong>: taking some content (world or idea)
and yielding a new representation with certain structure. Crucially,
each also <strong>discards</strong> something in translation (whether it
be fine-grained detail, individuality of instances, irrelevant
variables, or complexity of error distribution). They are thus
<strong>modal filters</strong>. None of them gives a complete picture
alone; but together, orchestrated in a cycle, they allow progressively
refining understanding. Figure 1 (conceptually) would show these
interfaces as nodes in a loop: <em>World <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> —(Observation)→ data idea <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> —(Abstraction)→ theory idea <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> —(Prediction)→ expected data idea
<span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> —(Evaluation)→ result <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> —(Memory)→ stored knowledge, which
then influences the next cycle’s observation or abstraction.</em>
Although we don’t present a literal diagram here, it may help to
mentally visualize this loop. Next, we formalize the entire recursive
cycle and discuss how the traversal through these interfaces can be
iterated and analyzed.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-cycle-of-discovery-formal-model">Recursive Cycle of
Discovery: Formal Model</h2>
<p>Having identified the components, we now integrate them into a
<strong>unified recursive process</strong>. In each iteration of
scientific inquiry, the system (a scientist or community) moves through
the interfaces described above, generating new ideas and updating old
ones. We can represent one cycle in an abstract form and then consider
its repetition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Start:</strong> Assume at the start of cycle <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> the scientist has some
<strong>prior state</strong> of knowledge encoded in memory as <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub></span> (which
could include prior theories, background assumptions, and past data).
The external world is in some state <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> ∈ <em>W</em></span>
relevant to the inquiry (e.g. the specific experiment or observation
context at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation:</strong> The world state passes through the
observational interface to produce an observational idea: <span
class="math display"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>).</span>
This <span class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is
now an <strong>empirical idea</strong> available to the scientist. It
could be a dataset, a sensory perception, a reading – whatever form the
observation takes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration:</strong> The scientist combines this new
observation with relevant prior ideas (from memory) to form a set of
inputs for hypothesis generation. Let <span
class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> denote the
input idea set for abstraction at cycle <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>. One reasonable choice is <span
class="math display"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = { <em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> } ∪ Select (<em>M</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub>),</span>
where <span
class="math inline">Select (<em>M</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub>)</span>
means the scientist selects some subset of stored knowledge that seems
relevant to current observation (this could include the most recent
theory or any context). In some cases, <span
class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> might just be
<span class="math inline">{<em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>}</span> if
working inductively from scratch, or largely old ideas if
re-interpreting data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypothesis Formation:</strong> Apply the abstraction
interface to generate a new hypothesis or update an existing one: <span
class="math display"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub>(<em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>).</span>
Here <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is
the hypothesis idea proposed at iteration <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>. If the scientist is testing an
existing theory, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> might
actually just return that existing theory unchanged (i.e. <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>h</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub></span>)
or a tweaked version thereof; if the scientist is exploring, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> might produce
a brand new conjecture to explain <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>. In our
formalism, both cases are covered: <span
class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> could contain
a prior hypothesis which, combined with new data, yields an adjusted
hypothesis. We allow <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> to produce
either a brand new idea or to refine an old one – mathematically it’s
just producing an idea from inputs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction:</strong> The hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is projected
into the observational domain to yield a prediction: <span
class="math display"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>).</span>
This <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>
represents what the scientist expects to observe given <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>. In practice,
<span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> might
depend on specifying how the observation is to be made, so more
explicitly one might have <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub>(<em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>))</span>:
the hypothesis guides an experimental setup <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub>(<em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>)</span>
(like “if <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is true, do X
to see Y”), and then <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> applied to
the world during that experiment yields an expected <span
class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>. But for simplicity, we
encapsulate this in a single step <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The predicted outcome <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is compared
with the actual observation <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> (or with a
later observation if one separates a confirmation experiment – we can
also imagine that after forming <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, the
scientist does a new experiment yielding <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em>′<sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, and
compares <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>)</span>
with <span class="math inline"><em>o</em>′<sub><em>t</em></sub></span>.
The indexing can be adjusted to fit scenarios, but the logic is the
same). The comparison interface gives: <span
class="math display"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>C</em>(<em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>,<em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>).</span>
If <span class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> was
the original observation that inspired <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, often one
would not compare <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> against the
<em>same</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> (since <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> was built to
explain <span class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>
in the first place – it will trivially fit). More typically, <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is split into
two parts (one for forming <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> and one for
testing it) or an entirely new <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub></span> is
acquired to test <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>. Our notation
can accommodate this by shifting indices, but to avoid confusion, think
of <span class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> here
as <em>new data used to test <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span></em>. The
outcome <span class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>
might be binary (“consistent” or “not consistent”) or a graded error. In
any case, it is an idea summarizing the success of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> under
scrutiny.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory Update:</strong> The cycle concludes by updating
the memory state: <span
class="math display"><em>M</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = Update(<em>M</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub>, <em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>, <em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>).</span>
In words, the memory now incorporates the new observation, the
hypothesis, and the evaluation result. The precise update rule can vary:
one may add <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> to the set of
accepted theories if <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> was
favorable, or mark it as refuted if <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> was
unfavorable, etc. One may store <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> in a database
of facts. One may discard or keep previous ideas depending on <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>. The
<strong>algorithm of science</strong> (if we think in AI terms) would
use <span class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> as
a loss to adjust <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> or to
generate a new hypothesis in the next cycle (<span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> + 1</span>). For example, if <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> indicates a
large error, in the next cycle the abstraction operator <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> might be
invoked with a different strategy or additional inputs to try a new
hypothesis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This completes one loop of the process. What makes it
<em>recursive</em> is that we then <strong>feed back into the next
iteration</strong>: <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> carries
information forward, and a new cycle <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> + 1</span> starts possibly with a new
observation <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub></span>, leading
to <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub></span>,
etc. The term <strong>recursive</strong> here also has a deeper meaning:
not only is the process iterative, but ideas from previous cycles can
become <em>objects of consideration in subsequent cycles</em>. For
instance, a theory <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> developed
early on can later itself become the subject of study – scientists can
form <em>meta-hypotheses</em> about why certain theories work, or
incorporate one theory into another. In a formal sense, the space <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> of ideas is being continually expanded and
remolded by the very process that uses it. There is a self-referential
flavor: science uses ideas (theories) to improve ideas (theories about
theories, better methods, etc.). This is analogous to the recursion and
self-reference discussed in the Interface Theory of Ideas, where an
interface can generate ideas about its own operation (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Now%2C%20beyond%20abstraction%2C%20consider%20ideas,body%20sensations%2C%20memories%2C%20and%20thoughts">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Self,Each%20act%20of">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). Here, the scientific method can itself
become an object of scientific study (e.g., psychology of science,
methodology research), which is the process taking itself as input.</p>
<p>Let’s illustrate the cycle with a <strong>concrete metaphor</strong>
to ground this formalism: Imagine a sculptor (the scientist) trying to
carve a statue (accurate knowledge) out of a block of marble (the
unknown reality). The sculptor’s chisel blows are like observations
(<span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span>
interacting with <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>) – each
strike reveals something (a piece falls away) but also is guided by an
idea of the form to achieve. The sculptor steps back to
<strong>conceptualize</strong> the shape emerging (<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> on what’s
seen and remembered of the intended shape). They then
<strong>predict</strong> how the next strike will shape it (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> simulating
outcome) and then strike and see the result, <strong>evaluating</strong>
whether it matches the intention (<span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> comparing intended vs actual
form). Over many iterations, the statue starts to resemble the
envisioned form more and more. However, crucially, the sculptor can
never put marble back, only remove – analogous to how each observation
removes possibilities and adds knowledge but we can’t recover what was
not observed. The hope is that by iterative refinement, the final statue
corresponds to the true form hidden in the marble (reality’s structure).
In our interface terms, each cycle should ideally improve the alignment
between the theory idea and the world’s actual patterns.</p>
<p>From a <strong>system perspective</strong>, one can view the
scientific enterprise as a <strong>dynamical system</strong> in the
space of ideas: <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>F</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub>,<em>w</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>)</span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> encapsulates the
operations above. This system seeks fixed points or attractors – a state
where the hypothesis no longer drastically changes cycle to cycle
because it consistently predicts observations well (thus <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is
continually “good”). Such an attractor would correspond to what we
consider a well-established <em>theory or law of nature</em>. In our
terms, that is an idea <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sup>*</sup></span> that has high
survivability <span
class="math inline"><em>S</em>(<em>h</em><sup>*</sup>)</span> across
many contexts and perhaps even becomes part of memory <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> as a trusted background element
for future abstractions. However, unlike a static fixed point, science
can always be perturbed by new observations or by reaching new domains
where the current interface fails. Then the process continues (as Kuhn
would say, normal science continues until a crisis causes a paradigm
shift – in our model, that’s just a bigger update when <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> starts
consistently signaling failure under new conditions).</p>
<p>It is also instructive to consider the <strong>limits of this
recursion</strong>. The Interface Theory of Ideas talks about the
<em>limit space of ideas</em> as an open horizon (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=modality,itself%20is%20interpreted%20as%20an">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=experience,cognitive%20makeups">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). In science, one can imagine an infinite
sequence of refining theories <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>h</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>h</em><sub>3</sub>, …</span>
approaching some ideal complete theory <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>∞</sub></span> in the limit. Whether
such a limit exists or is reachable is a matter of philosophical
speculation. It could be that reality’s richness is inexhaustible, so
the sequence never converges but just yields progressively better
approximations. Alternatively, perhaps there is a final theory of
everything (a true fixed point). Our framework does not assume either
way; it only provides the mechanism for movement. What it does suggest
is that <strong>each theory is an interface state</strong>, and a final
truth would be like a hypothetical interface that no longer loses
information – an ultimate perspective where prediction and observation
match perfectly because we have the full structural mapping. Whether the
human scientific method can reach that, or whether infinite new
modalities would be needed (as some think new physics always opens new
questions), remains open. We lean on the side of humility: historically,
every time it seemed we had nature figured out, new anomalies
(ultraviolet catastrophe, relativity, quantum phenomena, etc.) forced
expansions of our interface.</p>
<p>Thus, the recursion likely continues indefinitely, or at least as
long as curiosity and reality’s depth persist. In the next section, we
delve deeper into the nature of <strong>structural loss and
compensation</strong> in this process, examining how the chain of
interfaces manages to yield robust knowledge despite each link being
imperfect. We also explore how <em>equating all these stages as
fundamentally similar operations</em> helps dissolve certain
philosophical dichotomies – such as the divide between empirical and
theoretical or between observer and model – into a more integrated
view.</p>
<h2
id="structural-loss-compensation-and-the-equivalence-of-interfaces">Structural
Loss, Compensation, and the Equivalence of Interfaces</h2>
<p>A striking aspect of modeling discovery as we have is recognizing
that <strong>every phase – looking, thinking, testing, remembering – is
subject to structural loss</strong>. No part of the process gives us a
full, unmediated grasp of reality. And yet, the miracle of science is
that through <em>coordination</em> of these lossy steps, something like
an accurate picture emerges over time. How can that be? To answer this,
we consider how losses in one interface can be mitigated by insights
from another, and how understanding the <strong>equivalence of these
interfaces</strong> allows scientists to cleverly navigate
limitations.</p>
<p>First, let’s emphasize the universality of loss:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Observation’s loss:</strong> We only perceive certain
aspects (e.g. visible light, macro-scale features). We miss the rest
(e.g. other radiation, microscopic detail) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20our%20visual%20modality,to%20an%20acoustic%20sequence%20that">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). This not only limits what data we have,
but can mislead – for centuries, humans thought no other light existed
beyond the visible spectrum; it took extending our interface (infrared,
ultraviolet detection) to reveal more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conceptual loss:</strong> Our theories simplify; they
assume ceteris paribus (all else equal), ideal conditions, or focus on a
subset of variables. They also are limited by our conceptual vocabulary
– one cannot formulate an idea one doesn’t have building blocks for.
Before the concept of “germ” existed, one couldn’t hypothesize germ
theory of disease; the abstraction operators available were not yet rich
enough, partly due to lack of observations (microbes unseen) and partly
due to entrenched alternative abstractions (“miasma”). Thus, at any
point, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>
works with what it has and may ignore phenomena it doesn’t know how to
integrate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction/Experiment loss:</strong> Experiments often
have <strong>error bars</strong> and <strong>noise</strong>. <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub></span> might predict
an ideal value, but <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> returns <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> that fluctuates. The comparison
might categorize as “match” even if there’s some discrepancy, treating
it as noise. That means fine details of where theory and reality differ
can be overlooked until instruments improve. Additionally, experiments
can only isolate so much – e.g. you can’t simultaneously measure a
particle’s position and momentum with arbitrary precision (Heisenberg’s
uncertainty, a fundamental limit of one type of observational
interface). So <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span> plus <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> inevitably
has a resolution limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory loss:</strong> As discussed, memory might forget
anomalies or discard outliers. In fact, scientists sometimes
intentionally simplify history: when teaching or codifying knowledge,
they present an idealized narrative. Over time, this can lead to
<em>confirmation bias</em> if not careful, where only supporting data is
remembered. Good practice counters this with meta-level interfaces (like
peer review, or meta-analyses) that try to catch such biases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Given all these losses, it’s remarkable science works at all. The key
is <strong>redundancy and cross-checking</strong>. Each interface leaves
blind spots, but the <strong>recursive cycling</strong> means those
blind spots can be illuminated by another pass. For example, observation
might miss X, but a theory might predict X’s effects indirectly,
prompting a new kind of observation that reveals X. A famous instance is
the prediction of Neptune: irregularities in Uranus’s orbit
(observational discrepancy) were used by Urbain Le Verrier as input
(<span class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>) to
abstract a hypothesis of another planet (<span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>). That
hypothesis predicted a certain location in the sky (<span
class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>), which when
observed (<span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em> + 1</sub></span>) led to
discovery of Neptune. Here the <em>loss</em> in one observation
(couldn’t see Neptune initially) was compensated by a <em>theory</em>
that said “something unseen must be there,” which then led to an
augmented observation (point a better telescope at a predicted spot). In
terms of our framework, the interfaces were used in tandem: the
evaluation <span class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> signaled a
problem, the hypothesis interface conjectured a new idea to fill the
gap, the observation interface was extended (with a more powerful
telescope, essentially expanding <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span>’s
capabilities), and the thing initially lost became found. This
highlights how interfaces can be <strong>augmented or expanded</strong>
when needed: we build new instruments (new <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> modes),
invent new theoretical constructs (new uses of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>), etc.,
effectively enlarging <span class="math inline">ℐ</span> and refining
<span class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span>.</p>
<p>Thus, while each step is fallible, the scientific method’s recursion
is a <em>self-correcting</em> architecture. It doesn’t guarantee
immediate truth, but it provides a mechanism to detect its own failings:
when structural loss leads us astray, eventually a mismatch <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> appears that
cannot be ignored, prompting adjustments. This aligns with Karl Popper’s
notion of falsification: theories are not confirmed so much as surviving
attempts to falsify. In our terms, a theory with high survivability
<span class="math inline"><em>S</em>(<em>h</em>)</span> has been
subjected to many <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em>(<em>E</em><sub><em>P</em></sub>(<em>h</em>),<em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>))</span>
and yielded neutral or positive outcomes <span
class="math inline"><em>e</em></span> each time. It’s like a ship that’s
taken many voyages and no storm (experiment) has sunk it yet – we grow
confident it’s seaworthy, but a stronger storm could still come.</p>
<p>Now, an important philosophical implication of our model is the
<strong>blurring of distinctions</strong> between traditionally separate
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Empirical vs Theoretical:</strong> In classical
philosophy of science, observation is “empirical” and hypothesis is
“theoretical,” often seen as fundamentally different kinds of knowledge.
In our interface view, both are just <em>ideas in different
modalities</em>. Observation <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is an idea
shaped by the sensorimotor modality; a theory <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is an idea
shaped by conceptual modality. Both have structure, both are prone to
error, both are partial. Indeed, it has long been argued that
observation is <em>theory-laden</em> – our expectations and concepts
influence what we observe (we notice certain things and not others). Our
model explains this naturally: because observation <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> never comes
in isolation; it is usually taken <em>in context</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> that includes
memory (past knowledge). Thus <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span> (though here
acting to interpret data rather than to hypothesize anew) can be at work
in how raw <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub>(<em>w</em>)</span>
is framed. In practice, a raw sensor signal often becomes a meaningful
data point only when combined with a theory (“reading 0.7 on this meter
means low battery”). So the boundary between observation and inference
is porous. By treating them within one formal system, we avoid a false
dichotomy – they are continuous in the space of idea-generating
operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subjective vs Objective:</strong> One might ask, if
everything is an interface, is anything “objective”? Traditionally,
observations are seen as objective (given the same setup, any observer
would see the same) whereas theories might be considered more subjective
or at least creative. But in interface terms, objectivity can be
redefined as <strong>intersubjective consistency across
interfaces</strong>. For example, if multiple independent observers
(distinct instantiations of <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> perhaps, or
multiple scientists with separate cycles) all arrive at the same
observational idea <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span>, that idea
gains objectivity. It means despite different personal interfaces, the
projection converged to the same result – suggesting it’s an invariant
of the underlying reality. We can formalize this: an idea <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> is <em>objective</em> to the
extent that <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub><sup>(<em>a</em>)</sup>(<em>w</em>) = <em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub><sup>(<em>b</em>)</sup>(<em>w</em>) = <em>i</em></span>
for different observers <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em>, <em>b</em></span> and relevant world
state <span class="math inline"><em>w</em></span>. Similarly, a
hypothesis is objective (or rather, a scientific fact) once it is shared
and yields consistent <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>
outcomes across different attempts to falsify. Our architecture shows
how this sharing happens: through the memory/communication interface and
repeated cycles, a consensus builds. The concept of <strong>modal
invariants</strong> is key – if an idea persists through different modal
transformations (e.g., a theoretical relation holds true in different
experimental setups, and different observers record the same pattern),
it is regarded as real. In group theory terms, objectivity is invariance
under change of interface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reality and the Interface:</strong> Ultimately, our model
maintains a distinction between <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> (the world) and <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> (ideas), but it heavily emphasizes that
whatever we know of <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> comes
<em>through</em> <span class="math inline">ℐ</span>. We do not directly
operate on <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>; we operate on
ideas. Even our interventions <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>X</em></sub></span> (experiments)
and observations <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>O</em></sub></span> are mediated.
This resonates with Kantian philosophy: we never know the
“thing-in-itself” (noumenon) directly, only the phenomenon shaped by our
faculties (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Philosophically%2C%20the%20Interface%20Theory%20of,shaped%20by%20a%20specific%20context">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). However, our approach doesn’t retreat to
solipsism or say reality is arbitrary. On the contrary, the iterative
success of science implies <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>
has a <strong>consistent structure</strong> that underlies these
experiences (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=all%20is%20arbitrary,aspects%20of%20reality%20that%20were">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). The fact that we can converge on
theories that predict new observations means there <em>is</em> something
non-arbitrary out there. We just frame the acquisition of knowledge of
that something as a continuous negotiation between different
idea-modals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, by <strong>viewing observation, hypothesis, evaluation,
and memory as equivalent modal interfaces</strong>, we unify the
epistemic agents of science. They are all doing the same fundamental
thing: <strong>projecting and abstracting ideas with
constraints</strong>. This helps explain why improvements in one realm
(say technology for observation) can have analogous effects as
improvements in another (say mathematical tools for theory) – both
effectively expand the interface (increase the fidelity or bandwidth of
one of the <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> or add new
primitives and operators to <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>H</em></sub></span>), and thereby
allow discovery of patterns previously lost in translation (<a

Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). It also demystifies the process: there
is no magical gap where a wild hypothesis comes from nowhere or a brute
fact stands completely independent; each arises from prior interfaces
and feeds into subsequent ones. In a sense, this is a very
<strong>structuralist</strong> view of knowledge: each piece (fact or
theory) gets meaning from how it is produced and used in the structure
of inquiry, not from a standalone correspondence with reality (<a

<h2 id="implications-for-knowledge-meaning-and-reality">Implications for
Knowledge, Meaning, and Reality</h2>
<p>Reimagining scientific discovery as a recursive modal projection
system carries profound implications for how we interpret
<strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>meaning</strong>, and
<strong>reality</strong> itself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge as Interface Artefact:</strong> Knowledge
(scientific or otherwise) emerges in our model not as a passive
reflection of reality, but as an <strong>active, constructed interface
artifact</strong>. It is the end result of many transductions: reality →
perception, perception → concept, concept → prediction, etc. This means
all knowledge is <em>knowledge-for-us</em>, tailored to the modalities
we used. Just as a computer’s GUI icon for a file is not the file itself
but a convenient placeholder hiding binary complexity, a scientific
concept like “atom” is an icon hiding quantum fields and who-knows-what
underlying it. It’s <em>useful</em> and even <em>rigorously defined</em>
within a framework, but it’s still an interface simplification.
<strong>Epistemic humility</strong> is therefore a key implication (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=to%20our%20experiences%20%E2%80%93%20indeed%2C,that%20were%20invisible%20to%20us">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=human%20,that%20were%20invisible%20to%20us">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>): we should always be aware that what we
“know” could be upended by encountering a new modality or an anomaly
that our current interface cannot handle. However, this does not lead to
despair or radical relativism (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=One%20might%20worry%20that%20this,its%20limitations%20and%20to%20the">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). It’s more akin to being a skilled
map-maker who knows the map is not the terrain but trusts the map enough
to navigate, while always being ready to redraw parts if new lands are
discovered. Ourframework supports the idea that <strong>empirical
knowledge is reliable</strong> to the extent that it has been
cross-verified through many modal projections (making it robust), yet it
is <strong>provisional</strong> because a new kind of observation or
analysis could reveal gaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meaning through Structure:</strong> In this view,
<strong>meaning</strong> is not a static correspondence between idea and
object (as a naive realist might hold). Instead, meaning is something
that <strong>arises from the structural relations among ideas</strong>,
including the relations established through the discovery cycle. A
scientific concept means what it does because of how it was arrived at
and how it is used to generate predictions and explanations (its role in
the interface graph) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=if%20meaning%20is%20not%20intrinsic%2C,general%20concept%20abstracted%20from%20a">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=something%20partly%20because%20it%20contrasts,The%20value">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). For
instance, the concept of “energy” in physics is meaningful due to its
conservation properties, its role in countless formulas, its measurable
effects – all of which are nodes and links in the network of operations
scientists perform. If one tried to define “energy” in isolation, one
would get nowhere – it’s defined by an equation (<span
class="math inline"><em>E</em> = <em>m</em><em>c</em><sup>2</sup></span>
or <span class="math inline"><em>E</em> = constant in closed
system</span> etc.), by contrast with other concepts (kinetic vs
potential), by how we measure it (calorimeters, etc.). Our formal
approach, which encodes each idea by its unique construction path,
reinforces this: an idea’s identity (and thereby its meaning) is given
by <strong>its place in the structure of ideas</strong> (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/formal-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Our%20theory%20embodies%20the%20structuralist,is%20entirely%20defined%20by%20how">A
Formal Theory of Ideas via Minimal Binary Abstraction: Structure,
Uniqueness, and Generative Complexity from a Single Primitive</a>). Two
ideas that play the same structural role are effectively the same idea
in usage. This structuralist notion of meaning implies that as our
interface grows, meanings can shift. When a new discovery adds a twist
(e.g., “planet” meant one thing until we found exoplanets and dwarf
planets, forcing a structural reclassification), the concept’s meaning
evolves with the theory network. Thus, scientific terms are not
eternally fixed – they adapt with the web of ideas. This aligns with
Thomas Kuhn’s point that after a paradigm shift, even the same terms in
science may refer to subtly different concepts because the whole
structure changed. Our model provides a formal underpinning: the term
might be the same label, but the idea behind it now has a different
<span class="math inline"><em>π</em> → …→</span> structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reality as Modal Consensus:</strong> Perhaps the most
provocative implication is for the concept of <strong>reality and
scientific objectivity</strong>. In everyday discourse, we think of
science as uncovering “the way the world truly is” – an objective
reality independent of observers. Our account suggests a nuanced
picture: <strong>reality, as accessible to us, is inherently
<em>modal</em> and <em>structural</em>.</strong> What we call “objective
reality” might be identified with the structures in <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> that remain invariant under the
transformations of our interfaces. If every competent observer (with
similar interfaces) doing careful experiments (through similar
procedures) arrives at the same core idea (within error margins), that
idea is what we refer to as a <strong>real fact</strong>. In
group-theoretic language, reality is an invariant under the group of
transformations that represent changes of perspective or modality. For
example, the charge of an electron is “real” because no matter how we
measure it (within a huge range of methods and modalities), we get the
same number (within experimental uncertainty). It is interface-invariant
(or at least interface-covariant with a simple transformation rule). On
the other hand, something like “color” is not an intrinsic property of
reality but an interface-dependent construct – different species have
different color perceptions, and physics tells us color is a mix of
surface reflectance and lighting and eye response.</p>
<p>Our model thus aligns with a kind of <strong>pragmatic
realism</strong> or <strong>structural realism</strong>: there is a
mind-independent world (<span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>)
that constrains what ideas work (we can’t just believe anything; the
recursive testing would catch us out), but what we <em>mean</em> by
“real” are those stable patterns that survive all our filtering and seem
to transcend any one interface. It’s as if reality is the limit of this
recursive process – the unreachable ideal point where all losses are
eliminated and the idea matches the world perfectly. We never get there,
but we get ever closer by expanding interfaces. Indeed, the history of
science is one of <strong>expanding our interfaces</strong> to get
closer to reality’s heart (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=In%20adopting%20this%20attitude%2C%20we,new%20%E2%80%9Cphenomenal%20worlds%E2%80%9D%20accessible%20to">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=experience,cognitive%20makeups">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). We invented microscopes, telescopes,
cloud chambers, MRI machines – each is a new modality that reveals
aspects of reality previously filtered out. We developed formalisms like
complex numbers, Hilbert spaces – new conceptual modalities to
understand patterns that classical concepts couldn’t capture. Each time,
we peeled back a bit more of the “decorated veil” (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=Structural%20filtering%20explains%20why%20an,is%20cut%20off%2C%20and%20key">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>)between us and nature. Yet, each time we
also reveal new mysteries, suggesting the veil, while thinner, is still
there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objectivity redefined:</strong> Given this, scientific
objectivity is not the absence of a perspective, but the
<strong>synthesis of many perspectives</strong>. An objective claim is
one that has been tested and seen to hold from many angles – literally
through different instruments and logically via different derivations.
In our terms, an idea is objective if it can be projected through
multiple distinct <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> and still
consistently map to the same underlying idea or yield expected results.
For example, the wave-particle duality of electrons is objective in that
whether we do an interference experiment or a particle scattering
experiment, we must use both wave and particle concepts (two different
modal descriptions) to fully predict outcomes; the electron’s reality is
something that produces coherent results across those modes, even if no
single mode (pure particle picture or pure wave picture) suffices alone.
Thus objectivity comes from this <em>coordination across
interfaces</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limits of our architecture:</strong> Our model encourages
us to ask, what if there are aspects of reality that <strong>no
combination of our current interfaces can capture</strong>? It’s very
plausible. We may need entirely new primitives <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> or new forms of <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> or new modalities to even
represent certain phenomena. For instance, humans had no way to
conceptualize quantum entanglement before the mathematics of Hilbert
spaces and the experiments of the early 20th century gave a new
interface. If an alien intelligence had different sensory modalities or
cognitive primitives, might they uncover truths we literally cannot
represent yet? Our theory answers yes: since <span
class="math inline">ℐ</span> is built from what we have now, extending
<span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> might open up an expanded <span
class="math inline">ℐ′</span> that includes ideas currently unimaginable
(<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=In%20adopting%20this%20attitude%2C%20we,new%20%E2%80%9Cphenomenal%20worlds%E2%80%9D%20accessible%20to">The

Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). This is both exciting and humbling – it
means the space of possible knowledge is vast and perhaps unbounded, and
our current science is a subspace carved out by the recursive loop we’ve
run so far.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-reference and reflexivity:</strong> Finally, let’s
reflect on the reflexive aspect: science is part of the world, and
scientists are agents within <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>
using interfaces (their minds) shaped by evolution for survival, not
truth per se (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=interfaces%20optimized%20for%20survival%20,it%20mirrors%20an%20objective%20world">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=relativity%20because%20those%20had%20no,on%20survival%20at%20our%20scale">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). Yet here we are, seemingly accessing
profound truths about quantum fields and galaxies. This might be seen as
a happy accident or as evidence that once a basic interface evolved for
survival (e.g. our senses and brains), it could bootstrap itself through
tools and abstract ideas into a far more powerful meta-interface
(science itself). Our recursive model is precisely this bootstrap:
starting from primitives that helped us not get eaten on the savannah
(basic perception, counting, etc.), we applied repeated abstraction and
created new modalities (mathematics, scientific instruments). We
<em>turned the interface upon itself</em> to amplify its powers – a bit
like a mind hacking its own limitations. As a result, we greatly
expanded the range of experiences and ideas (we have “seen”
gravitational waves with LIGO, something no unaided sense could do; we
have “felt” the curvature of space-time through equations). This
suggests a view of the <strong>scientific endeavor as an open-ended
evolutionary process</strong> – not of organisms, but of interfaces and
ideas. Each discovery is not just finding a fact, but also often results
in new questions, new concepts, or new tools (a new interface) that then
enable further discovery (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=experience,cognitive%20makeups">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). There’s a creative, almost artistic,
dimension here: like a recursive art project where the painting draws
itself by creating new brushes for new details.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In concluding, we are left with a picture of science that is both
systematic and poetic. It is systematic in that we can formalize it as a
well-defined recursive algorithm, an interplay of sets and functions
rigorously specified. It is poetic in that this algorithm, when
interpreted, tells the story of <strong>humanity’s quest for
understanding</strong>: a repeated casting of a net (our interface) into
the sea of reality, catching some fish (ideas), learning from them,
repairing and recasting the net in an endless iterative dance. The
<strong>objectivity</strong> we gain is hard-won – it is the knowledge
that remains invariant no matter how we twist and turn our lenses. The
<strong>meaning</strong> we create is relational – a symphony of
concepts each giving context to the other, not solitary notes. And the
<strong>reality</strong> we approach is ever the asymptote – we move
closer but remain at some remove, which perhaps is fortunate, as it
guarantees an eternal intrigue: there will always be something left to
discover, as long as we have the curiosity to keep the recursive cycle
in motion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have developed a monograph-length exploration of
<strong>Scientific Discovery as Recursive Modal Projection</strong>,
marrying formal precision with philosophical reflection. By viewing the
scientific method through the dual lenses of the Formal and Interface
Theories of Ideas, we arrive at a deeply integrated understanding:
<em>scientific discovery is a process whereby ideas continually reinvent
themselves across various modes of representation</em>. Each mode – be
it seeing, theorizing, experimenting, or remembering – provides a
partial view, a <strong>modal lens</strong>, onto the underlying
reality, and only through their repeated interplay do we inch toward a
more complete picture.</p>
<p>This framework yields several <strong>transformative
insights</strong>. It dissolves the rigid stepwise image of the
scientific method into a <strong>flexible, looping architecture</strong>
where any step can prompt revisiting any other. It formally encodes why
science is <em>not</em> a straightforward march to truth, but a winding
path shaped by the <strong>constraints of our interfaces</strong> – our
senses, our languages, our mathematical tools all limit and guide what
we find. It reveals scientific progress as <strong>interface
expansion</strong>: when our current modalities fall short (as when
Newtonian mechanics couldn’t explain Mercury’s orbit), we innovate new
ones (Einstein’s spacetime conception) and thereby capture new aspects
of reality. In doing so we echo the adaptive creativity of life itself,
which evolves new organs to sense and adapt. The <em>recursive modal
projection</em> model can thus be seen as an epistemic analogue of
evolution: variation (new hypotheses) and selection (experiments)
operating on ideas, with memory preserving the gains. What survives is
not “truth” in an absolute sense, but a hardy <strong>structure of
ideas</strong> that has weathered many projections and remains
coherent.</p>
<p>Finally, our journey invites a humbling yet inspiring perspective on
the <strong>nature of scientific objectivity and reality</strong>. We
come to recognize objectivity not as a god’s-eye view from nowhere, but
as a <strong>consensus from everywhere</strong> – the convergence of
many subjective viewpoints through communication and testing. And we
recognize reality’s truths not as jewels lying ready to be picked, but
as sculptures we reveal with careful chisel strokes, knowing full well
that the sculpture is shaped by our tools even as it reflects an
underlying form. The <strong>architecture we proposed – of <span
class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span>, and <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> – bridges mind and world</strong>
without collapsing one into the other. There <em>is</em> a world that
constrains our experiences, but everything we know of it comes through
our self-made filters. Appreciating this, we can avoid both arrogant
scientism (the illusion that we have final answers) and cynical
relativism (the despair that it’s all arbitrary). Instead, we adopt what
the Interface Theory terms <strong>epistemic humility</strong> (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=human%20,that%20were%20invisible%20to%20us">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=art%20,or%20in%20technology">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>): a stance that celebrates the incredible
<strong>effectiveness</strong> of our recursive interface (science has
unlocked wonders, from quantum theory to genetic medicine) while also
acknowledging its <strong>limitations</strong> (there may be phenomena
we can’t even articulate yet).</p>
<p>In closing, the recursive modal model of discovery is more than a
philosophical curiosity; it has practical resonance. It suggests that to
foster discovery, one should cultivate diversity in modalities –
encourage looking at problems visually, analytically, experimentally,
introspectively, etc., because each modal projection might reveal a new
pattern. It suggests that education in science should not just impart
facts, but teach the young scientist how to <strong>navigate
interfaces</strong>: how to observe keenly, abstract insightfully,
experiment cleverly, analyze honestly, and remember usefully. And it
offers a unifying language for talking about breakthroughs in different
fields, from AI (where multi-modal learning is becoming key) to
cognitive science (understanding how humans solve problems by shifting
perspectives). All these can be seen as instances of the same core
algorithm we have detailed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Scientific Discovery as Recursive Modal
Projection</em> paints a picture of science as a living, breathing
<strong>conversation between the human mind and the universe</strong>,
moderated by the structures of thought and perception. It is a
conversation in which each question asked is shaped by how it is asked,
and each answer leads to new questions by altering the very lens through
which we ask. And yet, through this recursive dance, we have been able
to approximate a stunning tapestry of understanding – one that, while
woven by us, captures real patterns that extend far beyond us. In the
spirit of this realization, we conclude with a metaphorical
reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scientific knowledge is like a cathedral built of
ideas</strong>, each arch and buttress an abstract concept supported by
observations as foundation stones. We construct it with imperfect tools
– chisels that chip and molds that compress – yet as it rises higher, we
see more of the horizon. We cannot soar above and view the whole
blueprint from the sky; we only see it from within. But over centuries,
by adding perspective upon perspective, we inch closer to a divine view
– never fully there, but enough to sense the grandeur of the reality we
strive to know. Each of us is both prisoner and architect of our
interfaces, but together, recursively, we <strong>build windows in the
walls of our understanding</strong>, letting the light of reality
illuminate our collective mind.</p>
