<p>Contemporary theories across cognitive science and philosophy
converge on the idea that perception and thought do not mirror an
objective world in full fidelity, but instead <em>project structured
representations</em> that sacrifice detail for usefulness. Donald
Hoffman’s <strong>Interface Theory of Perception</strong> epitomizes
this view: our perceptions are like a computer’s desktop interface –
shaped by natural selection to hide the complex “truth” and only display
what aids adaptive behavior (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384988/#:~:text=monotonically%20with%20truth,Our%20perceptions%20of">The
Interface Theory of Perception - PubMed</a>). In Hoffman’s words,
<em>“our perceptions of space-time and objects have been shaped by
natural selection to hide the truth and guide adaptive behaviors.
Perception is an adaptive interface.”</em> (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384988/#:~:text=monotonically%20with%20truth,Our%20perceptions%20of">The
Interface Theory of Perception - PubMed</a>) This implies a
<strong>lossy compression</strong> of reality: we only perceive a
filtered structure of the world, much as an icon hides the circuitry
inside a computer (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26384988/#:~:text=PC,selection%20to%20hide%20the%20truth">The
Interface Theory of Perception - PubMed</a>). Philosophers Humberto
Maturana and Francisco Varela similarly argue that an organism <em>“does
not see a world ‘out there’ that exists apart from us. Rather, we see
only what our systemic organization allows us to see. The world merely
<em>triggers</em> changes determined by the system’s own organization.
The world cannot instruct an observing system; [instead] the world is
constructed by the observing system.”</em> (<a
href="https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/tag/maturana/#:~:text=the%20central%20premise%20of%20Autopoiesis,the%20world">Maturana
| Harish’s Notebook - My notes… Lean, Cybernetics, Quality &amp; Data
Science.</a>) In this view, the mind is a <strong>structure-determined
system</strong> (<a
href="https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/tag/maturana/#:~:text=the%20central%20premise%20of%20Autopoiesis,the%20world">Maturana
| Harish’s Notebook - My notes… Lean, Cybernetics, Quality &amp; Data
Science.</a>), continually “bringing forth a world” through its embodied
activity (<a
href="https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/tag/maturana/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20do%20not%20see%20what,%E2%80%9D">Maturana
| Harish’s Notebook - My notes… Lean, Cybernetics, Quality &amp; Data
Science.</a>) – effectively an interface between sensory inputs and
internal models.</p>
<p>This <em>interface perspective</em> is reinforced by Daniel Dennett’s
notion of <strong>“real patterns.”</strong> Dennett proposes that what
we call “reality” is composed of patterns that our minds capture via
compression: <em>“A pattern exists in some data – is real – if there is
a description of the data that is more efficient than the [raw data] bit
map.”</em> (<a
href="https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/FP2012/FP2012_readings/Dennett_RealPatterns.pdf#:~:text=A%20pattern%20exists%20in%20some,of%20transmitting%20exact%20copies%20of"></a>)
In other words, we latch onto <em>information that can be economically
described (for some observer)</em>, ignoring the rest as “noise.”
Cognition, from this standpoint, is <em>sensitive to certain structural
regularities</em> while discarding vast details – much like a lossy
projection that preserves only salient structure. This explains how
different observers or models can carve up reality differently,
depending on what they compress or ignore (<a
href="https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/FP2012/FP2012_readings/Dennett_RealPatterns.pdf#:~:text=A%20pattern%20exists%20in%20some,of%20transmitting%20exact%20copies%20of"></a>)
(<a
href="https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/FP2012/FP2012_readings/Dennett_RealPatterns.pdf#:~:text=When%20two%20individuals%20confront%20the,noise"></a>).
Even our <strong>folk psychological narratives</strong> about beliefs
and intentions can be seen as projecting a simplified, definite
structure (“hard edges”) onto the underlying neural complexity (<a
href="https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/FP2012/FP2012_readings/Dennett_RealPatterns.pdf#:~:text=process%20that%20produces%20the%20data,and%20precision%2C%20thanks%20to%20the"></a>)
– a point Dennett connects to how language (a mode of expression)
imposes apparent definiteness on inherently fuzzy mental processes (<a
href="https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/FP2012/FP2012_readings/Dennett_RealPatterns.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L926%20process%20that,and%20precision%2C%20thanks%20to%20the"></a>).</p>
<p>Cognitive scientists have formalized these ideas in the brain’s
functioning. R.L. Gregory famously described perception as a process of
<strong>unconscious hypothesis</strong> testing. He wrote that
<em>“Perceptions may be compared with hypotheses in science. The methods
of acquiring scientific knowledge provide a working paradigm for
investigating processes of perception.”</em> (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6106237/#:~:text=Perceptions%20may%20be%20compared%20with,are%20processed%20according%20to%20various">Perceptions
as hypotheses - PubMed</a>) The brain’s sensory pathways are not passive
channels but <em>actively interpret signals based on prior knowledge and
assumptions</em>, just as scientists interpret data via theories (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6106237/#:~:text=Perceptions%20may%20be%20compared%20with,generating">Perceptions
as hypotheses - PubMed</a>). Systematic perceptual errors (illusions)
are <em>“important clues”</em> that reveal the brain’s built-in
assumptions, much like failed hypotheses in science reveal where our
theory is wrong (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6106237/#:~:text=perception,distinction%20between%20%27physiological%27%20and%20%27cognitive">Perceptions
as hypotheses - PubMed</a>). This aligns closely with modern
<strong>predictive processing</strong> models, which conceive the brain
as a recursive prediction engine. In these models, the brain constantly
generates a <em>“mental model”</em> to predict incoming sensory signals
and then adjusts itself based on the prediction errors (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding#:~:text=In%20neuroscience%20%2C%20predictive%20coding,follow%20the%20Bayesian%20brain%20hypothesis">Predictive
coding - Wikipedia</a>). The guiding principle – often cast in Bayesian
terms – is to minimize surprise or loss (e.g. Friston’s <strong>Free
Energy Principle</strong>), highlighting that cognition is organized
around <em>error/loss functions</em> guiding the update of our
“interface” representations (<a

Kriger | THE COMMON SENSE WORLD | Mar, 2025 | Medium</a>). In short, a
broad range of thinkers (from evolutionary psychology to neuroscience)
support the notion that <strong>cognition is a lossy projection of
reality</strong>: we perceive and think in terms of user-friendly icons,
hypotheses, or patterns that are optimized for utility or fit (in an
evolutionary or pragmatic sense) rather than veridical detail (<a

<h2 id="recursive-cycles-of-reasoning-and-discovery">Recursive Cycles of
Reasoning and Discovery</h2>
<p>The process of scientific discovery itself has long been described as
<em>iterative and recursive</em>. Classical philosophy of science views
inquiry as a <strong>cycle</strong> of conjecture and test. Karl
Popper’s famous schema of “conjectures and refutations” portrays
knowledge growth as an unending feedback loop: <em>bold hypotheses are
proposed, deduced for consequences, then rigorously tested in attempts
to refute them; those that survive are provisionally retained, and the
cycle repeats</em> (<a
href="https://www.bookey.app/book/conjectures-and-refutations#:~:text=This%20cycle%20begins%20with%20the,because%20it%20allows%20us%20to">Conjectures

And Refutations Summary PDF | Karl Popper</a>). As a summary puts it,
<em>“scientific knowledge evolves through a cycle of conjectures and
refutations… bold and imaginative guesses about the nature of reality
[are] then rigorously tested… through this relentless cycle of proposing
and discarding hypotheses, science advances”</em> (<a
href="https://www.bookey.app/book/conjectures-and-refutations#:~:text=scientific%20knowledge%20evolves%20through%20a,way%20that%20it%20can%20be">Conjectures
And Refutations Summary PDF | Karl Popper</a>) (<a
href="https://www.bookey.app/book/conjectures-and-refutations#:~:text=When%20a%20hypothesis%20is%20refuted%2C,in%20their%20theorizing%2C%20but%20equally">Conjectures
And Refutations Summary PDF | Karl Popper</a>). This
<strong>self-correcting recursion</strong> ensures that each loop
(hypothesis → experiment → outcome → revised hypothesis) refines our
theories, much as each iteration of a learning algorithm reduces error.
The <em>hypothetico-deductive model</em> formalizes a similar loop:
formulate hypothesis, deduce predictions, collect
observations/experiments, then update or reformulate hypotheses (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model#:~:text=1,This%20formal%20fallacy%20is">Hypothetico-deductive
model - Wikipedia</a>) (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model#:~:text=One%20possible%20sequence%20in%20this,4%2C%201%2C%20and%20so%20forth">Hypothetico-deductive
model - Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>Notably, <em>Charles S. Peirce</em> anticipated these ideas in his
19th-century logic of science. Peirce identified
<strong>abduction</strong>, or inference to a hypothesis, as the crucial
leap in inquiry – <em>“the only logical operation which introduces any
new idea”</em> (<a
href="https://thecynefin.co/abduction-through-entanglement/?srsltid=AfmBOoqAIm6SeW-0qZ-N8lw8YLyO5oHlm6sYxiDZ84hO8Hdn__dDJdlu#:~:text=,216">Abduction
through entanglement - The Cynefin Co</a>). In Peirce’s triadic cycle,
<strong>abduction</strong> generates a new plausible idea to explain
surprising facts, <strong>deduction</strong> works out its testable
consequences, and <strong>induction</strong> evaluates those
consequences against experience, leading either to the hypothesis’s
provisional acceptance or to another cycle of abduction (<a
href="https://thecynefin.co/abduction-through-entanglement/?srsltid=AfmBOoqAIm6SeW-0qZ-N8lw8YLyO5oHlm6sYxiDZ84hO8Hdn__dDJdlu#:~:text=,216">Abduction
through entanglement - The Cynefin Co</a>). This recursive loop (often
depicted as a cycle of hypothesis generation → experimentation →
evaluation) closely mirrors the phases outlined in <em>“recursive modal
projection”</em>: <em>generation, observation, evaluation, refinement,
memory</em>. Each phase can be seen as a <strong>mode of
cognition</strong> that transforms the content and feeds into the next.
For example, generation (abductive mode) produces an idea, observation
mode gathers data under a given framing, evaluation compares outcomes to
expectations (inductive confirmation or falsification), refinement
adjusts the idea (or generates new ones) based on that feedback, and
memory stores the knowledge for future cycles – thereby influencing the
next generation phase.</p>
<p>(<a
href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Scientific_Method.png">File:The
Scientific Method.png - Wikimedia Commons</a>) <em>Illustrative
schematic of an iterative inquiry process.</em> This simple flowchart
shows a <strong>recursive loop</strong> in the scientific method:
starting with a Question and background Research, a Hypothesis is
formed, an Experiment is conducted to gather Data, leading to a
Conclusion that feeds back to new Questions. Each loop of this process
corresponds to transforming ideas through different
<strong>modalities</strong> – hypothesizing, observing, analyzing – akin
to the modal phases of <em>recursive modal projection</em>. Such
diagrams emphasize that scientific reasoning is not a linear path but an
ongoing, cyclic <strong>feedback system</strong> (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#:~:text=Nonetheless%2C%20the%20cycle%20of%20formulating,50">Scientific
method - Wikipedia</a>) (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#:~:text=below,50">Scientific
method - Wikipedia</a>). In practice, scientists refine their hypotheses
repeatedly (“iterate”) in light of new data, embodying <em>recursive
abstraction refinement</em>. Philosopher Daniel Dennett has even
compared this to <strong>evolutionary algorithms</strong>: the mind can
generate many “variations” of ideas and then selectively retain the ones
that work, an analogy originally formalized by Donald Campbell. In 1960,
Campbell proposed that <em>“creative thought should be conceived as a
blind-variation and selective-retention process (BVSR)”</em> (<a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1571064510000199#:~:text=retention%20www,retention%20process%20%28BVSR">Creative
thought as blind-variation and selective-retention</a>). In this
evolutionary epistemology, each new hypothesis is a random variation and
experimental testing acts as a selection mechanism, filtering out the
failures – effectively a <strong>recursive generate-and-test
loop</strong> driving discovery. Modern psychology of creativity and
problem-solving echo this: for instance, the <strong>Geneplore
model</strong> (Finke, Ward &amp; Smith) describes creative cognition as
alternating between generative phases (producing ideas or “preinventive
structures”) and exploratory phases (evaluating and elaborating those
structures), cycling until a satisfactory outcome emerges. Douglas
Hofstadter likewise underscores the iterative nature of high-level
cognition: he famously argued that <em>analogy</em> is <strong>“the core
of cognition”</strong>, with thought continually mapping previous
structures onto new situations to spawn novel insights (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy#:~:text=communication%20,2">Analogy
- Wikipedia</a>). Every analogy or metaphor is a mini <em>abductive
leap</em> – a projection of a known structure onto a new context – which
is then assessed and refined. This fits neatly into a recursive loop
model: analogies generate candidate understandings, which are then
evaluated and either confirmed, adapted, or discarded, looping until the
problem is solved.</p>
<p>Crucially, these cycles are <strong>self-referential</strong> and
<strong>abstraction-driven</strong>. Each complete loop can enrich an
evolving body of knowledge (memory), which then informs the next
iteration. As Peirce noted, reasoning is <em>“a sort of dialogue”</em>
the mind has with itself, where each phase’s outcome becomes the input
(or premise) for the next. This resonates with later cybernetic models
of learning (e.g. the <strong>OODA loop</strong> in decision theory:
<em>Observe–Orient–Decide–Act</em>, continually repeated). It also
parallels how AI systems refine models: for example, a modern AI might
generate an initial model, test it against data, compute a loss (error),
and then update the model – a recursive optimization cycle conceptually
similar to scientific inquiry. In sum, there is broad support (from
Peirce and Popper through modern cognitive science and AI) for treating
<strong>knowledge-seeking as an iterative, modal process</strong> in
which different cognitive modes (hypothesizing, experimenting, etc.)
feed into each other in a closed loop (<a

<h2 id="related-paradigms-in-cognitive-science-and-ai">Related Paradigms

<p>The theoretical framework of “recursive modal projection” finds
parallels in several interdisciplinary domains. In <strong>enactive
cognitive science</strong>, Varela and Maturana’s work on
<em>autopoiesis</em> and <strong>structural coupling</strong> posits
that an organism’s cognitive apparatus and its environment are locked in
a continuous loop of mutual specification. This means the organism
<em>enacts</em> a world through perception-action cycles, rather than
passively reflecting a pre-given world (<a

| Harish’s Notebook - My notes… Lean, Cybernetics, Quality &amp; Data
Science.</a>). Each perception-action cycle can be seen as a traversal
through modalities (sensing, moving, adjusting internal state, etc.),
and the organism’s history (its memory of interactions) biases what it
brings forth next. This aligns with the idea that each cognitive “phase”
transforms content and passes it on: in enactivism, <em>“living itself
is an act of cognition”</em> (<a
href="https://harishsnotebook.wordpress.com/tag/maturana/#:~:text=primarily%20because%20they%20believe%20it,direct%20involvement%20in%20the%20world">Maturana
| Harish’s Notebook - My notes… Lean, Cybernetics, Quality &amp; Data
Science.</a>), and the loop of sensorimotor engagement is inherently
recursive. In a similar vein, <strong>extended mind</strong> theories
(Clark &amp; Chalmers) and second-order cybernetics (von Foerster)
acknowledge that what we call “cognition” often involves iterative
interaction with external structures (instruments, media, notations) –
essentially <em>projecting mental structure outwards and then perceiving
it anew</em>. David Kirsh describes how humans <em>“project” mental
structures onto physical substrates and then read them back</em> to
amplify thinking (<a

Word - cogsci_projection_final_new_ending1.docx</a>), an interactive
loop of externalization and re-internalization. Such observations
support treating phases like external observation and internal
generation as integrated parts of one <strong>recursive cognitive
system</strong>.</p>
<p>In artificial intelligence, researchers have explicitly modeled
multi-phase reasoning loops. The field of <strong>computational
scientific discovery</strong> (pioneered by Herbert Simon and Pat
Langley in the 1980s) built AI programs like <em>BACON</em>,
<em>GAUSS</em>, and <em>KEKADA</em> that simulate the cycle of discovery
– generating hypotheses from data regularities, testing against
experiments (simulated data), and refining the hypotheses. These systems
showed that alternating phases of proposal and critique can rediscover
scientific laws. More recently, advanced AI systems employ
<strong>meta-learning</strong> or self-refinement loops. For example,
large language models like GPT-4 can be configured in a <em>reflective
loop</em> where one module proposes an answer and another evaluates and
revises it, iterating until consistency is achieved (<a

Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (RIAI): The Future of …</a>).
Similarly, <em>AlphaGo</em>’s self-play is a form of recursive
improvement (each game’s outcome updates the policy for the next game),
and <em>automated scientists</em> like the robot scientist “Adam” form
hypotheses about gene functions, design experiments, and iteratively
update their hypotheses – a literal hardware instantiation of the
recursive discovery cycle. In machine learning, the idea of
<strong>abstraction levels</strong> is often handled by hierarchical
models: e.g., deep neural networks propagate information through layers
(each layer transforming representations), which can be seen analogously
to modalities feeding into one another. Furthermore,
<em>abstraction-first</em> approaches (like program synthesis or
symbolic regression in scientific ML) generate high-level conjectures
and then test them on data, mirroring the generate-and-test modality
interplay. It’s notable that <em>modern AI research on reasoning is
rediscovering the value of recursion</em>: techniques like <strong>Tree
of Thoughts</strong> and <strong>ReAct</strong> (Reason+Act) involve
models iteratively reasoning step-by-step and evaluating partial
solutions, which strongly resembles the theoretical phases of
generation, evaluation, refinement.</p>
<p>The concept of an <strong>“interface of ideas”</strong> could also
draw on <em>analytic philosophy</em>. For instance, Hilary Putnam’s and
Douglas Hofstadter’s reflections on <strong>analogy and conceptual
mappings</strong> highlight that we understand new domains by projecting
structures from familiar domains (with inevitable loss of detail). Each
such analogical mapping is evaluated and possibly refined or rejected –
again an internal loop. Even the <strong>semiotic</strong> process
described by Peirce (sign → interpretation → new sign) is an infinite
recursive loop: <em>semiosis</em> never fully resolves, it keeps
generating new interpretants (analogous to refined hypotheses). This
underscores that any representational system is involved in a
<em>recursive interpretation</em> of itself, much as the paper’s
framework suggests the phases are unified in a recursive system.</p>
<h2 id="formal-models-and-frameworks-to-augment-the-theory">Formal
Models and Frameworks to Augment the Theory</h2>
<p>To further formalize and visualize recursive modal cognition, we can
draw on mathematical and computational frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Category Theory</strong>: As a “mathematics of
structure,” category theory has been applied to cognitive science to
model compositional and hierarchical relationships. Phillips and Wilson
(2016) propose a category-theoretic account of
<strong>systematicity</strong> in cognition, wherein cognitive
capacities are composed via <em>universal constructions</em>. Notably,
they argue that <em>“every universal construction can be viewed as the
optimal construction in the given context (category). From this view,
[such constructions] are derived from learning, as an
optimization.”</em> (<a
href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01139/full#:~:text=cognition%2C%20albeit%20in%20restricted%20contexts,a%20category%2C%20then%20a%20natural">Frontiers
| Systematicity and a Categorical Theory of Cognitive Architecture:
Universal Construction in Context</a>) In other words, finding a
universal construction is akin to solving a constraint optimality –
strongly echoing the idea of projection with a loss function (the
construction is <em>optimal given a context</em>). This hints that each
modality in our cognitive loop might be represented as a functor or
mapping between categories (e.g., a hypothesis space and an observation
space), with <em>loss minimization</em> corresponding to universal
property (optimal mapping). Higher-order categories (categories of
categories) are suggested for modeling how context itself might evolve
(<a
href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01139/full#:~:text=in%20the%20given%20context%20%28category%29,order%20category%20theory%2C%20where">Frontiers
| Systematicity and a Categorical Theory of Cognitive Architecture:
Universal Construction in Context</a>), capturing the
<em>self-referential</em> aspect of a system that can alter its own
modes. The <strong>Memory Evolutive Neural System (MENS)</strong> of
Ehresmann and Gómez-Ramirez is another categorical model: it uses
colimits (a category theory concept) to characterize how <strong>mental
objects emerge by iterative binding</strong> of neural assemblies (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26193173/#:~:text=The%20paper%20discusses%20how%20neural,a%20new%20rationale%20of%20spatial">Conciliating
neuroscience and phenomenology via category theory - PubMed</a>). Thanks
to the <em>degeneracy</em> of neural codes (multiple different neural
microstates realizing the same mental state), MENS can explain how
higher-order cognitive structures form with flexible implementation (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26193173/#:~:text=synchronous%20assemblies%20of%20neurons%2C%20and,notions%20of%20Compositionality%2C%20Productivity%20and">Conciliating
neuroscience and phenomenology via category theory - PubMed</a>). This
degeneracy is essentially a formalization of <em>losing certain details
while retaining structure</em>, enabling general concepts – and is
<em>“essential to explain phenomena like productivity and systematicity
of thought.”</em> (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26193173/#:~:text=result%20is%20that%20the%20degeneracy,It%20also%20allows%20developing%20the">Conciliating
neuroscience and phenomenology via category theory - PubMed</a>) By
mathematically distinguishing the neural (micro-level) and mental
(macro-level) dynamics, MENS provides a rigorous way to unify different
modalities (perception, memory, etc.) in one framework. Intriguingly,
Ehresmann and Gómez-Ramirez note that such a formalism <em>“allows
developing the naturalized phenomenology approach asked for by Varela
(1996) which seeks mutual constraints between lived experience and
cognitive science”</em> (<a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26193173/#:~:text=MENS%20lead%20to%20precise%20notions,while">Conciliating
neuroscience and phenomenology via category theory - PubMed</a>),
fulfilling in mathematics what the theory of recursive modal projection
aims for conceptually: a bridge between subjective cognitive phases and
objective structural modeling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamical Systems</strong>: Another modeling avenue is to
view the entire cognitive loop as a single dynamical system – a set of
state variables (representing the contents of each modality or memory)
that evolve over time according to coupled differential (or difference)
equations. Each “phase” of the discovery process could correspond to a
sub-dynamics or attractor in this system. Dynamical systems theory has
been used to explain cognitive phenomena like rhythmic cycles of
attention, decision-making oscillations, and learning as trajectory
wandering in a complex energy landscape. A famous example is Tim van
Gelder’s argument that cognition might be akin to a Watt governor
(continuous feedback loop) rather than a discrete computational
algorithm. In our context, one could imagine a <strong>phase
space</strong> where each point encodes (for instance) the current
hypothesis, expectations, and stored knowledge, and the system’s laws
cause it to spiral through
“generation→observation→evaluation→refinement” in a continuous loop.
<em>Fixed points</em> of this system would represent stable discoveries
or beliefs, and <em>limit cycles</em> could represent regularly updating
knowledge (as in periodic hypothesis revision). Such a view could be
made concrete with <strong>neural dynamics models</strong> –
e.g. recurrent neural networks that implement a form of scientific
reasoning by having internal cycles that settle into states (hypotheses)
that best predict inputs (data), reminiscent of predictive coding
networks minimizing error over time. Tools from dynamical systems
(Jacobians, Lyapunov functions) might then be used to analyze stability
of knowledge or the sensitivity (chaos) of the discovery process to
initial conditions (prior knowledge).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computational Architectures and Simulations</strong>: We
can also look at cognitive architectures like <strong>Soar, ACT-R, or
OpenCog</strong>, which often have iterative perceive–decide–act loops.
For example, Soar breaks problem-solving into sequences of decision
cycles and subgoals, where impasses trigger new hypothesis generation (a
bit like abduction) and learning mechanisms store the results. This
resonates with the modal phases: <em>impasse = need for new generation;
state update = observation; operator selection = evaluation; chunking =
memory storage</em>. A formal mapping could potentially be made between
these architectures and the recursive modal model (each phase as a
function from one representational state to the next). Additionally,
<strong>Markov decision processes (MDPs)</strong> and <strong>Bayesian
networks</strong> offer formal means to represent iterative refinement:
one could model the state of scientific understanding as a belief
distribution that gets <em>updated (Bayesian inference)</em> with each
new piece of evidence (observation modality) and occasionally
<em>expanded (proposal of new hypothesis priors)</em> when anomalies are
high. The <em>loss function</em> idea surfaces here as well – e.g. the
<em>negative log-likelihood</em> of observations given the current model
can serve as a loss to minimize. Recent AI research on <strong>automated
theorem proving</strong> and <strong>program synthesis</strong> is also
relevant: these systems use <em>heuristic search through an abstract
space</em> of possible solutions, often employing recursive strategies
(like divide-and-conquer or iterative deepening) to find a proof or
program. They sometimes visualize reasoning as a <em>search tree</em>
that is explored and pruned, which is analogous to navigating a network
of ideas with backtracking – a process not unlike a scientist exploring
hypotheses and ruling them out. Insights from these algorithms (like
methods to avoid getting stuck in local optima, or to balance
exploration vs exploitation) could inform the “refinement” modality of
the model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visualization and Schematics</strong>: Conceptually, the
recursive modal projection framework could be illustrated by a
<strong>nested loop or spiral diagram</strong>. One might depict five
circles or nodes (for generation, observation, evaluation, refinement,
memory) with arrows indicating the flow from one to the next in
sequence, but also a larger arrow curling from <em>memory</em> back to
<em>generation</em> to indicate recursion (the next cycle starts where
the last left off). Additionally, each node could be drawn as an
<strong>operator</strong> that takes an input and yields an output
(e.g., <em>generation:</em> takes stored knowledge + curiosity → yields
new hypothesis; <em>evaluation:</em> takes prediction + data → yields a
judgment or error signal; etc.). This would highlight the
<em>modularity</em> of each phase yet show the
<strong>compositionality</strong> when linked in a ring. In fact,
category theory could provide the rigor for such a diagram: one could
model each cognitive modality as a morphism (with an associated functor
capturing its loss function or optimization criterion), and the
composition of these morphisms around the loop as the overall cognitive
process. A fixed-point of the composite (a point where running through
all modalities returns you to the same idea state) would represent a
fully refined idea that no longer changes – perhaps an analog to a final
“discovery” that gets committed to long-term memory and is no longer
contested.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that the <strong>philosophical
lineage</strong> of these ideas spans centuries. From Kant’s insight
that our mind contributes forms to experience (imposing structures like
space, time, causality – effectively a projection) to Hegel’s
dialectical cycles of thesis-antithesis-synthesis (a recursive progress
of ideas), many frameworks have viewed knowledge as <em>actively
constructed via iterative interplay</em> rather than passively received.
The <em>recursive modal projection</em> model situates itself in this
lineage, and the sources gathered – from Peirce’s logic to modern AI –
provide a rich scaffolding to support and extend it. Each source offers
a piece of the puzzle: <strong>why cognition must be lossy</strong> (to
be tractable and fitness-enhancing), <strong>how iterative loops drive
learning</strong> (ensuring continual self-correction and innovation),
and <strong>how we might formally capture such a system</strong>
(through mathematics of mappings, dynamics, or computations). Taken
together, these references both validate the framework’s premises and
suggest pathways to refine it into a more unified theory of scientific
discovery and creative cognition.</p>
