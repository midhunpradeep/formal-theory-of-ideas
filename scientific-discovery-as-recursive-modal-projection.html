<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>We propose a formal and philosophical framework in which
<strong>scientific discovery</strong> is conceptualized as a
<strong>recursive process of modal projection</strong>. In this view, a
scientific theory or hypothesis is iteratively projected into various
<strong>modalities</strong> (contexts such as experimental setups,
empirical observations, or conceptual perspectives), yielding outcomes
that feed back to refine the theory. We formalize a <em>modal projection
operator</em> that maps a hypothesis and a chosen mode to predicted
observations, and an <em>update operator</em> that adjusts hypotheses
based on the mismatch between prediction and actual result. Through
successive cycles, scientific knowledge evolves as hypotheses are honed
to better project onto reality’s different facets. This recursive loop
of prediction and revision captures both the incremental accumulation of
knowledge and the occasional transformative shifts in understanding. The
framework bridges deductive and inductive phases of the scientific
method in a single recursive schema. Philosophically, it illuminates why
scientific knowledge is <strong>provisional</strong> yet
<strong>progressive</strong>—each projection reveals only a slice of
reality, and yet through recursive refinement, our theories converge
toward deeper truths without ever claiming a final absolute truth. We
maintain a tone that is rigorous yet reflective: mathematical structures
underpin the process, while poetic insight highlights the interplay
between <strong>imagination and experience</strong>. In presenting
scientific discovery as recursive modal projection, we offer a unifying
perspective on how science advances, emphasizing its creative,
self-correcting, and open-ended nature.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Scientific discovery is often portrayed as a cycle of conjecture and
refutation, of theory and experiment informing one another. But can we
<strong>formalize this dynamic</strong> in a way that captures its
recursive, self-correcting character? In this paper, we argue that the
process of scientific discovery can be understood as an
<strong>iterative projection</strong> of ideas into various modalities
of observation and thought. By <em>modalities</em>, we mean distinct
contexts or modes in which a theory can express itself—such as different
experimental configurations, measurement techniques, or even conceptual
viewpoints. Each modality provides a unique perspective on the
underlying reality, highlighting certain aspects while obscuring others.
When a scientist formulates a hypothesis, it does not remain a mere
abstraction; it is <strong>projected</strong> into these concrete modes
(for example, by making specific predictions in a laboratory setting).
The results of that projection—<strong>observations</strong>—are then
fed back into the conceptual realm to update or refine the hypothesis.
This <strong>feedback loop</strong> is repeated, making the process
inherently recursive.</p>
<p>This view emphasizes that scientific theories are not static
descriptions but <strong>living, adaptive constructs</strong>. A
hypothesis gains meaning only when we attempt to <em>instantiate</em> it
in a particular modality (say, an experiment or a simulation) and
observe the outcome. If the outcome aligns with the theory’s prediction,
the projection is validated for that modality; if not, the theory must
evolve. Importantly, there are many possible modalities and perspectives
through which a theory can be tested or explored. Thus, discovery
involves navigating a <strong>space of modalities</strong>, each test
acting as a projection of our ideas onto reality’s canvas. Over time and
recursive trials, the theory may broaden to accommodate more modalities
or, conversely, become more specialized to handle anomalies.</p>
<p>Our approach builds on classic insights from the philosophy of
science while extending them with a formal twist. <em>Karl Popper’s</em>
principle of falsifiability, for instance, is naturally captured in our
framework: a failed projection (prediction) in some modality forces a
revision of the hypothesis. Likewise, <em>Thomas Kuhn’s</em> notion of
paradigm shifts can be seen as cases where minor adjustments to a
hypothesis no longer suffice; instead, a <strong>fundamental
reconfiguration</strong> of the theoretical framework occurs—essentially
jumping to a new region in the space of hypotheses when the current one
cannot be reconciled with modal outcomes. By placing these ideas in a
formal recursive schema, we aim to show how <strong>continuous
incremental progress</strong> and <strong>discontinuous
revolutions</strong> in science are two extremes of the same process of
recursive modal projection.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper develops these ideas in a structured
manner. In the <strong>Formal Framework</strong>, we introduce precise
definitions for hypothesis spaces, modalities, projection and update
operators, and formalize the notion of a discovery cycle. We keep the
notation minimal, focusing on clarity and fundamental structure. Next,
under <strong>Interpretive Postulates</strong>, we outline key guiding
assumptions that connect the formal model to actual scientific practice,
ensuring that our abstractions remain grounded in reality. We then move
to a broader <strong>Discussion</strong> of what this perspective
implies for our understanding of science, comparing it with established
views and exploring consequences like the open-endedness of inquiry and
the role of creativity. Finally, in the <strong>Conclusion</strong>, we
reflect on the significance of casting discovery as a recursive modal
process, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of this
framework and pointing toward future investigations (including the
reflexive observation that this very theory of discovery must itself be
subject to refinement). Throughout, we strive to maintain a balance
between <strong>mathematical rigor</strong> and <strong>philosophical
depth</strong>, aiming for a presentation that is formally precise yet
enriched by an intuitive, almost poetic, understanding of scientific
pursuit.</p>
<h2 id="formal-framework">Formal Framework</h2>
<h3 id="hypothesis-space-and-modalities">Hypothesis Space and
Modalities</h3>
<p>We begin by defining the basic components of our model of scientific
discovery. Let <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> be the set of
all <strong>hypotheses</strong> or <strong>theories</strong> under
consideration. An element <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> ∈ <em>H</em></span> represents a specific
conceptual model or explanatory framework that a scientist might hold.
This could range from a simple propositional hypothesis to a complex
theoretical construct; we do not fix its internal structure here,
treating <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> abstractly as the
space of possible ideas about the world.</p>
<p>Next, let <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> be a set of
<strong>modalities</strong> (or modes of inquiry). Each mode <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span> represents a distinct
way in which a hypothesis can be explored or tested. A modality could
correspond to an experimental setup, an observational perspective, a
mathematical formalism, or more broadly any context that yields
information about the hypothesis. For example, in physics, one modality
might be a high-energy collider experiment, another might be an
astronomical observation, and yet another a computer simulation. In
psychology, one modality could be a behavioral experiment, another a
neural imaging study. We remain general: <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is simply the collection of all
contexts or channels through which hypotheses in <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> can interface with empirical or
conceptual reality.</p>
<p>It is crucial to note that <strong>modalities partition the way
information is obtained</strong>. Each <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span> can be thought of as
focusing on certain aspects of reality while ignoring others. No single
modality gives a complete picture of a hypothesis; rather, each yields a
<em>projection</em> of the hypothesis into a particular representational
or observational space. This aligns with the intuition that different
experiments or perspectives provide complementary insights. Just as
light passing through different filters reveals different features of an
object, a theory subjected to different modalities may show varied
facets of truth.</p>
<h3 id="projection-and-update-operators">Projection and Update
Operators</h3>
<p>With hypotheses and modalities defined, we introduce the core
operations that drive the discovery process. First is the
<strong>projection operator</strong>. We define a function (or
relation)</p>
<p>[ P: H M O, ]</p>
<p>mapping a hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> ∈ <em>H</em></span> and a modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span> to an
<strong>observation</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em> ∈ <em>O</em></span>. Here <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em></span> denotes the set of all possible
observational outcomes (the <strong>observation space</strong>). We can
interpret <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>) = <em>o</em></span>
as <em>the predicted or expected outcome</em> when hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> is examined under modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. In practice, <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> could be quantitative data,
qualitative observations, or any result that the modality yields. For a
well-specified theory <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> and a
well-designed experiment <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>,
<span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>)</span> might
produce a deterministic prediction (e.g., a specific numerical value for
a measurement) or a probabilistic one (a distribution of possible
outcomes). We do not fix <span class="math inline"><em>O</em></span> or
the nature of <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> in detail;
<span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> encapsulates whatever it is
that the theory <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>
<em>projectively</em> says should happen in context <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>.</p>
<p>Crucially, the actual outcome of testing <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> in modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>—which we might denote <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub>exp</sub></span>—could differ from
the ideal prediction <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em> = <em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>)</span>.
Scientific discovery hinges on comparing <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>)</span> with what
actually occurs. If <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub>exp</sub></span> matches <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span>, the hypothesis is supported (at
least in that modality); if not, a <strong>discrepancy</strong> has been
revealed. We formalize the incorporation of such discrepancies with an
<strong>update operator</strong>. Let</p>
<p>[ U: H O H, ]</p>
<p>be a function that takes the current hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> ∈ <em>H</em></span> and an observed
outcome <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub>exp</sub> ∈ <em>O</em></span>
(typically, an outcome obtained from some modality test) and produces an
<strong>updated hypothesis</strong> <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>′ = <em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em><sub>exp</sub>)</span>.
The intention is that <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>
adjusts or revises <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> in light
of the new evidence <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub>exp</sub></span>. How exactly <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> operates can vary: it could be a
minimal adjustment to better fit the data, a more substantial change if
the data starkly contradicts <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>, or even a complete replacement of
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> with a new hypothesis. In
formal terms, we do not pin down a single update rule; <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> represents the general capacity
for theories to be modified in response to evidence.</p>
<p>We can, however, describe some properties that a reasonable update
operator should have. Ideally, <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em>)</span> should
yield a hypothesis <span class="math inline"><em>h</em>′</span> that, if
the same modality <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> that
produced <span class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> is applied again,
the prediction aligns better with <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span>. That is, if <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub>exp</sub></span> was the result of
testing <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> with modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, then for the updated <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>′ = <em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em><sub>exp</sub>)</span>,
we would expect <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>′,<em>m</em>)</span> to equal
(or at least more closely agree with) <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub>exp</sub></span>. In other words,
<span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> tries to <em>resolve the
discrepancy</em> such that the projection of the new hypothesis in the
tested modality reproduces the observed outcome. This captures the basic
corrective aim of scientific theory change: adjust the theory so that
what was surprising or anomalous becomes expected under the new
theory.</p>
<h3 id="the-recursive-discovery-process">The Recursive Discovery
Process</h3>
<p>With <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> defined, we can now conceive of
<strong>scientific discovery as an iterative (recursive)
process</strong>. Starting from some initial hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>0</sub> ∈ <em>H</em></span> (which
could be an educated guess or even a random conjecture), scientists
perform a series of projections and updates. At each <em>step</em> <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Projection:</strong> Choose a modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> ∈ <em>M</em></span>
in which to test the current hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>. Compute the
predicted outcome <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>P</em>(<em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>,<em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Apply modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> in the real
world (or in thought, if it is a conceptual test) to obtain the actual
outcome <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>exp</sup></span>.
Compare <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>exp</sup></span>
with the predicted <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>.</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Produce a revised hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub> = <em>U</em>(<em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>,<em>o</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>exp</sup>)</span>.
The new hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> is thus
informed by the result of the projection of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> in modality
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process then repeats, yielding a sequence of hypotheses <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>h</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>h</em><sub>2</sub>, …</span>
as well as a trail of tested modalities and observations. We can denote
the entire cycle concisely as:</p>
<p>[ h_{n+1} = U(h_n,; o_n^{}), o_n^{} h_n m_n. ]</p>
<p>The term “recursive” is apt because the output at each stage (the
updated hypothesis) becomes the input for the next projection. Over
time, this recursion ideally drives <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> toward
hypotheses that are <strong>more robust</strong>—meaning they can
project successfully across an expanding range of modalities without
significant discrepancies. In the limit (if one could imagine an
infinite sequence of tests and updates that lead to convergence), one
might approach a hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sup>*</sup></span> that is a fixed point
of sorts: <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>h</em><sup>*</sup>,<em>o</em><sup>*</sup>) = <em>h</em><sup>*</sup></span>
for all observations <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sup>*</sup></span> consistent with <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em><sup>*</sup>,⋅)</span>. Such an
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sup>*</sup></span> would be a
theory that perfectly predicts outcomes in all modalities tested. In
reality, of course, scientists never truly reach a final fixed point of
perfect agreement with all possible observations; there are always new
modalities or more precise measurements to try, and thus always the
possibility of further refinement. Nonetheless, we can see progress when
the changes in <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> become
smaller or less radical as <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>
grows, indicating that the theory is <strong>stabilizing</strong>
relative to the domain of experiments done so far.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this formalism does not assume that there is
a single predetermined path or that all scientists will take the same
route through the space of hypotheses. The <strong>choice of modality
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> at each
step</strong> can follow various strategies. It could be
<em>exploratory</em> (trying a new kind of test to broaden coverage of
<span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>), or <em>focused</em>
(repeating tests in a narrow subset of modalities to refine specific
parameters), or <em>anomaly-driven</em> (selecting modalities where the
current hypothesis is known to perform poorly, in order to target its
weaknesses). The formal model leaves this choice open, but different
strategies correspond to different styles of scientific inquiry. What
the model does emphasize is that <strong>multiple modalities</strong>
are eventually necessary to thoroughly test a hypothesis. If one only
ever projects a theory in a single mode, one only ever sees one aspect
of its validity. Robust scientific knowledge requires that a hypothesis
survive projections across many diverse modalities <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span>.</p>
<p>Our framework so far is minimalist: it abstracts the scientific
method into a cycle of projection <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> and update <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>. Despite (or rather, thanks to)
this simplicity, it captures an array of familiar concepts. If <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>)</span> produces a
<em>set of expected outcomes</em>, then a modality test resulting in an
outcome outside that set flags a <em>falsification</em> of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> (Popper’s criterion). The update
<span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> in that case might
drastically alter <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> or even
replace it—akin to rejecting a theory outright. If the outcome lies
within the expected range but perhaps pushes some quantitative
discrepancy, <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> might make a
minor tweak to <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> (like
adjusting a parameter), representing <em>normal science</em>
fine-tuning. Over many recursive cycles, <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> might undergo
<strong>cumulative evolution</strong>, staying within the same general
theoretical framework while becoming more precise—a bit like how
Newtonian theory improved over time with better measurements. However,
occasionally the accumulation of discrepancies may force <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> into a regime
where no small tweak yields agreement; the only successful update is
effectively a <strong>paradigm shift</strong> to a qualitatively new
hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> that
reinterprets prior observations in a different light (analogous to
Newtonian mechanics being superseded by Einstein’s relativity when
modalities involving high speeds and gravitation extremes came into
play). All these scenarios—incremental improvement, parameter
adjustment, and wholesale theory replacement—are allowable outcomes of
the <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> operator depending on
the nature of <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>exp</sup></span>
relative to <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>,<em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary, the formal framework of recursive modal projection
provides a <strong>unified schema</strong> for scientific discovery: a
hypothesis and a context produce a predicted experience, reality
provides the actual experience, and the hypothesis is recursively tuned.
We now turn to bridging this formal view with the practice and
philosophy of science by outlining a few interpretive postulates.</p>
<h2 id="interpretive-postulates">Interpretive Postulates</h2>
<p>To ground the formalism in reality, we articulate several key
postulates that connect our abstract model to how scientific discovery
operates in practice. These <em>interpretive postulates</em> serve as
conceptual bridges, ensuring that each formal element (<span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>, etc.) corresponds to a meaningful
aspect of real-world science.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Partial Truth Postulate:</strong> <em>No single modality
reveals the whole truth of a hypothesis.</em> Each modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span> provides a partial
projection of the underlying reality. Thus, a theory might appear valid
in one mode of inquiry yet fail in another. This postulate acknowledges
that empirical reality has many facets (e.g. different experimental
conditions, scales, domains), and a hypothesis might need to be tested
across all relevant facets for a full evaluation. It cautions against
overgeneralization from limited tests: success in one modality (say, one
type of experiment) does not guarantee universal validity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fallibilism Postulate:</strong> <em>All projections are
subject to error, and all hypotheses are subject to revision.</em> In
formal terms, for any non-trivial hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> and modality <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, there exists some outcome <span
class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> in <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em></span> that could force an update <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em>) ≠ <em>h</em></span>.
This encapsulates a principle of <strong>fallibilism</strong>: no
scientific theory is final, because future observations (perhaps in a
new modality or a more refined version of an existing one) can always
overturn it. This postulate aligns with the spirit of Popper’s
falsifiability criterion – the idea that a theory must always be
testable and vulnerable to being proven wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Convergence Postulate:</strong> <em>Over iterative
refinement, hypotheses tend to increase their domain of validity.</em>
If a sequence of hypotheses <span
class="math inline">(<em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>)</span> results
from repeated projections and updates with ever-broadening modality
tests, then in general the “successful projection set” of each
hypothesis expands or stays the same: a refined hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> should
not lose validity in modalities where <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> was valid
(except in cases of paradigm shift where the meaning of the hypothesis
changes, which we treat separately). This postulate expresses an
<strong>optimistic view of scientific progress</strong>: through
recursive improvement, our theories explain an ever larger array of
phenomena (they project correctly into more contexts). It doesn’t
guarantee monotonic progress—setbacks can occur—but overall it posits a
tendency toward broader, deeper understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paradigm Shift Postulate:</strong> <em>When local updates
within a framework fail, global revision occurs.</em> In terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>, most updates modify <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> incrementally (adjusting
parameters, adding minor caveats). But if for a given <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> there arises a cluster of
modalities in which projections consistently fail, then the only
effective update is a non-incremental one: <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em><sub>exp</sub>)</span>
produces an <span class="math inline"><em>h</em>′</span> that is
fundamentally different from <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>
in structure. This corresponds to Kuhn’s paradigms: the hypothesis space
<span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> is conceptually partitioned
into regions (paradigms), and sometimes the route to resolving anomalies
jumps from one region to another rather than moving within one. The
formalism can accommodate this by recognizing that <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> is not constrained to a small
neighborhood of <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>—it can, in
principle, output a radically new hypothesis. The postulate here is that
such jumps are rare and usually triggered by accumulation of
insurmountable anomalies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reality Postulate:</strong> <em>There exists an
underlying consistency to observations that theories seek to
capture.</em> We assume there is some structured reality which generates
the outcomes we observe in different modalities (even if that reality is
only partially or indirectly accessible). This justifies why convergence
of hypotheses is possible and meaningful—there is something to converge
<em>to</em>. Formally, one might imagine there is an unknown “true”
hypothesis <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sup>*</sup></span> (not
necessarily in our hypothesis set <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> explicitly) that perfectly
projects onto all modalities, i.e. <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em><sup>*</sup>,<em>m</em>) = <em>o</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>m</em>)</span>
matches the actual outcome for every <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. Our hypotheses in <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span> are attempts to approximate this
ideal. The reality postulate prevents a slide into extreme relativism or
the view that because each modality is a limited perspective, there is
no coherence to be found. Instead, it posits that the diversity of
perspectives can nonetheless be pieced together by a sufficiently
powerful theory.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These interpretive postulates are not mathematically derived from the
formalism; rather, they are philosophical assumptions that inform how
the formalism is to be used and understood. Together, they assert that
while our model of recursive modal projection is abstract, it is
<em>about something real</em>: scientists refine theories (fallibilism)
by testing in different ways (partial truth across modalities) and
generally manage to improve them over time (convergence) sometimes
undergoing major revolutions (paradigm shifts) in pursuit of capturing
an underlying truth (reality). With these in mind, we proceed to discuss
the broader implications and insights afforded by this framework.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="bridging-deduction-and-induction">Bridging Deduction and
Induction</h3>
<p>One immediate virtue of viewing discovery as recursive modal
projection is that it naturally <strong>unifies deductive and inductive
components</strong> of science. The projection operator <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>)</span> embodies
the <em>deductive</em> step: from a general hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>, we deduce expectations for a
specific modality <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. The
update operator <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em>)</span> embodies an
<em>inductive</em> or <em>abductive</em> step: from a particular result
<span class="math inline"><em>o</em></span>, we infer a refined
hypothesis. Traditional accounts of the scientific method often separate
these—one first deduces predictions, then one inductively alters the
theory. Here they are two halves of one loop, mathematically entwined.
This helps clarify why neither pure deduction nor pure induction
suffices in isolation: deduction (<span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>) tells us what should happen
<em>if</em> our theory is correct, induction (<span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>) tells us how to adjust when
reality shows something else, and only in tandem and iteration can they
produce reliable knowledge.</p>
<p>Our model also provides insight into the <strong>heuristics of
discovery</strong>. Different strategies of choosing the next modality
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>
correspond to different philosophies of research. For example, an
approach akin to <em>Baconian empiricism</em> might systematically vary
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> to gather as broad a base of
facts as possible before heavily updating the theory (emphasizing
breadth in <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> early on). In
contrast, a more <em>Popperian strategy</em> might deliberately seek out
modalities expected to falsify <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>, honing in on
the weak spots of the current hypothesis to aggressively test it. A
<em>Kuhnian normal science</em> phase could be seen as repeatedly using
well-established modalities that are known to confirm and calibrate the
theory, doing small <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> updates
to extend <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> gradually, whereas
a <em>Kuhnian crisis</em> involves focusing on modalities where <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> is failing
and perhaps having to consider a radical <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> step. In this way, our formalism
doesn’t just unify deduction and induction in theory, but offers a
language to describe how scientists may pragmatically alternate between
exploratory and confirmatory modes, broad versus deep inquiries, etc.,
all within the recursive loop.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-progress-and-revolutionary-jumps">Continuous Progress
and Revolutionary Jumps</h3>
<p>By accommodating both incremental updates and paradigm shifts, the
recursive modal projection framework portrays scientific progress as
neither purely smooth nor purely episodic, but as a combination of both.
Most of the time, science advances by <strong>continuous
refinement</strong>. This is seen in our model when <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> yields <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> that is a
slight modification of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>—for instance,
tweaking a parameter, adding a minor auxiliary hypothesis, or extending
the theory to cover a slightly broader domain. These small steps
correspond to day-to-day research where each experiment adds a piece of
knowledge and theories evolve gradually. The <strong>Convergence
Postulate</strong> supports this mode by suggesting that <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> often
retains the successes of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> while fixing
some of its problems, thereby monotonically increasing overall
explanatory power.</p>
<p>However, the model also inherently allows for <strong>revolutionary
jumps</strong>. If the update operator takes the scientist outside the
immediate neighborhood of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> in hypothesis
space—because nothing in that neighborhood can reconcile <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> with the new
observation—then <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> might be
a qualitatively different hypothesis. In practice, this is akin to a
<em>scientific revolution</em>: the language or conceptual framework of
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> may
not be directly comparable to that of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>. For example,
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> might
treat space and time as separate absolute entities (Newtonian paradigm),
and after a crisis and radical update, <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub></span> treats
space-time as a unified, relative entity (Einsteinian paradigm). Both
hypotheses address some of the same observational questions (they can
both be projected onto, say, planetary motion modalities), but they
conceptualize the mechanics differently. Our <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> operator can still apply to
each—just with different internal logic—and produce outcomes to compare
with observations; what changes dramatically is the structure of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> itself.</p>
<p>In the formal view, such a shift might be represented by <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> that is discontinuous: small
changes in <span class="math inline"><em>o</em></span> lead to small
changes in <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> usually, but at a
paradigm shift point, a relatively small additional discrepancy might
trigger a large jump in hypothesis space. This reminds us of a
<strong>non-linear dynamics</strong> analogy: a system usually near
equilibrium but occasionally undergoing a bifurcation. The recursive
process can thus exhibit <strong>path dependence</strong> and
<strong>sensitivity to anomalies</strong>: most discrepancies result in
minor adjustments, but certain crucial anomalies, if they cannot be
patched, force a reconceptualization.</p>
<p>From a <strong>historical perspective</strong>, this dual character
aligns well with the record of science. Long periods of cumulative work
(e.g. the gradual elaboration of the germ theory of disease) are
punctuated by upheavals (e.g. the quantum revolution in physics). Our
model conceptually encompasses both under one process—simply different
magnitudes or scopes of updates in the recursion.</p>
<h3 id="modalities-and-the-growth-of-understanding">Modalities and the
Growth of Understanding</h3>
<p>An important implication of the <strong>Partial Truth
Postulate</strong> is that expanding the range of modalities <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is as crucial to scientific
progress as refining hypotheses in <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>. New instruments, new
observational techniques, and new domains of inquiry effectively add new
modalities (or extend the reach of existing ones) in which to project
our theories. When Galileo turned a telescope to the heavens, he
introduced new modalities of observation (telescopic astronomy) that
could test hypotheses about celestial bodies in unprecedented ways. In
our framework, this can be seen as expanding the set <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, which in turn drives discovery: a
hypothesis that was untestable (or trivially true) before might now
yield a non-trivial projection <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em><sub>new</sub>)</span>
that can be checked. If <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>
fails this new test, <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> will
generate a new hypothesis, thereby advancing knowledge. Thus,
<strong>technological and methodological innovations</strong> are
catalysts for discovery because they enrich the modal spectrum
available.</p>
<p>We also see how <strong>cross-modal consistency</strong> becomes a
hallmark of robust scientific theories. A strong theory is one that, for
a large subset of <span class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, yields
predictions <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>)</span> matching
observations. This cross-modal agreement is essentially what we mean by
a theory having wide explanatory power. Conversely, a domain-specific
hypothesis might work well in one modality (say, a particular lab
condition) but not generalize. Scientists often seek unifying theories
that explain diverse phenomena (modalities) under one framework—our
model provides a precise way to think about that: a hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> that can remain invariant (no
major updates needed) through projections on many <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> ∈ <em>M</em></span>.</p>
<p>The framework also underscores the role of <strong>modal
filtering</strong>: every modality filters reality, meaning that some
phenomena might never be observed if we don’t have the right modality.
For instance, certain subatomic particles went undetected until
modalities like cloud chambers and later particle colliders were
developed. Until those modalities existed, hypotheses about those
particles could not be directly projected or confirmed. This ties to the
philosophical idea from the <em>Interface Theory</em> (as referenced in
our earlier work) that our perception (or instruments) provide an
interface to reality with limited bandwidth. In the context of science,
modalities define that bandwidth. The optimistic side is that by
deliberately engineering new modalities, we extend our interface and can
bring more aspects of reality into the fold of scientific inquiry. The
<strong>history of science can be seen as a history of expanding
modalities</strong>: each new observational or experimental capability
opens a new dimension of the world to be understood.</p>
<h3 id="recursion-reflexivity-and-the-meta-theory">Recursion,
Reflexivity, and the Meta-Theory</h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of framing discovery as a
recursive process is the inherent <strong>reflexivity</strong> it
suggests about science. Scientists are themselves a part of the system
they study, and their methods evolve as they learn. Our theory – the
recursive modal projection model – can be applied to itself in a
meta-scientific context. Consider that our current model is a hypothesis
about how discovery works. We can project it in various modalities of
analysis: historical case studies (does it adequately describe the
discovery of DNA’s structure or the development of quantum mechanics?),
cognitive science experiments (do scientists actually operate in a way
consistent with this model?), computational simulations (if we implement
an AI that uses this recursive method, does it effectively discover
scientific laws?). These are different modalities in which the
hypothesis “scientific discovery operates via recursive modal
projection” can be tested. The outcomes of these tests would then lead
us to update our model accordingly. In other words, the scientific
community can recursively improve its <em>understanding of discovery
itself</em> by treating meta-science as just another scientific endeavor
subject to hypotheses and experiments. This reflexive application
illustrates that our framework is not only descriptive but potentially
<strong>prescriptive</strong>: it might guide how we structure inquiry
into science’s own processes.</p>
<p>This reflexivity resonates with the idea that science is a
<strong>self-correcting enterprise</strong> at multiple levels. Not only
do scientific theories correct themselves about the world, but science
as a methodology corrects and refines itself over time. The emergence of
the modern experimental method, statistical hypothesis testing, peer
review, and even philosophies of science (like falsificationism) can be
seen as updates to the “hypothesis of how to do science” in response to
observed shortcomings of earlier practices. Thus there is a recursive
meta-loop: not only do scientists iterate theory-experiment cycles, but
the very rules and tools of those cycles are subject to evaluation and
improvement.</p>
<p>Finally, by explicitly acknowledging the role of modalities and
projection, our framework encourages a stance of <strong>epistemic
humility</strong> akin to that in the Interface Theory of Ideas (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=to%20our%20experiences%20%E2%80%93%20indeed%2C,that%20were%20invisible%20to%20us">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>) (<a
href="https://midhunpradeep.github.io/formal-theory-of-ideas/interface-theory-of-ideas.html#:~:text=human%20,that%20were%20invisible%20to%20us">The
Interface Theory of Ideas</a>). We recognize that what we call knowledge
is always mediated through specific contexts and instruments. There may
be aspects of reality our current modalities cannot yet touch, meaning
there could be truths our current best theories don’t even approximate
because we haven’t projected them in the right way. The recursive
process is, in principle, unbounded—there is always room to find a new
mode or detect a finer discrepancy. This means that science doesn’t
march toward a pre-fixed destination; it <strong>explores an expanding
frontier</strong>. Each discovery is not just an answer but also opens
new questions (new modalities to try, new phenomena to explain). Our
formalism captures this open-endedness by not assuming <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span> is fixed once and for all, and by
allowing the sequence <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> to continue
indefinitely. In practice, this translates to the notion that there will
always be mysteries at the edge of our understanding, and the scientific
journey is never complete.</p>
<h3 id="implications-for-artificial-discovery-and-beyond">Implications
for Artificial Discovery and Beyond</h3>
<p>While our focus has been on human scientific practice, the recursive
modal projection framework has implications for <strong>automating
discovery</strong>. If one were to design an artificial intelligence
(AI) system to conduct scientific research, the formalism provides a
blueprint: the AI would maintain a hypothesis (or a set of hypotheses)
and have access to various modalities (which could be virtual
experiments, data sources, simulations, etc.). By iteratively applying
something like <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> to generate
predictions and then <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> to
update its hypotheses based on results, the AI could in principle mimic
the strategy of scientific investigation. Indeed, some approaches in
machine learning and AI that aim for <em>active learning</em> or
<em>Bayesian experimental design</em> echo this pattern: the system
chooses an experiment (modal choice), gets data, and updates its model.
Our framework is more general and abstract, but it offers a way to think
about the guarantees and behaviors of such a system. For instance, one
might ask: will an AI scientist guided by recursive modal projection
converge to a correct theory given enough time and modalities? This ties
into our Convergence Postulate and Reality Postulate—under certain
conditions (e.g., accurate models of <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> and sufficiently expressive
hypothesis space <span class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>), we would
expect convergence to the true underlying hypothesis <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sup>*</sup></span>. Understanding the
formal conditions for convergence or identifying when a search might get
stuck in a local paradigm could inform how we program AI to avoid or
escape such traps (perhaps by deliberately injecting more diverse
modality exploration).</p>
<p>Beyond science, one could metaphorically apply the idea of recursive
modal projection to other realms of knowledge and even daily
problem-solving. Anytime we have a model of something and we test it in
different scenarios, learning and adapting as we go, we engage in a
similar loop. This is essentially the process of <strong>learning by
trial and error</strong> cast in abstract terms. The broad applicability
of the concept speaks to why the scientific method has been so
successful: it taps into a fundamental strategy for acquiring reliable
knowledge applicable by any sufficiently intelligent agent.</p>
<p>However, it is important to remember the <strong>limits</strong> of
our formalism. It simplifies a lot. Real scientific theory change can be
influenced by sociological factors, psychological biases, and accidental
discoveries that are outside the neat structure of <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>U</em></span>. Modalities might not be explored
just because they exist; funding, interest, or available technology play
a role. Our framework assumes an idealized search of hypothesis space
driven purely by empirical feedback. This ideal is a powerful guide, but
actual science sometimes deviates from it. A discussion of scientific
discovery would be incomplete without acknowledging that models like
ours are normative or descriptive ideals that complement, rather than
fully replace, the rich story told by historians and sociologists of
science. In a sense, the recursive modal projection is an <strong>ideal
scaffold</strong>—a way to frame how discovery <em>could</em> proceed
under rational conditions. The real world will always add wrinkles to
that picture.</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind, we can now recapitulate what we
have achieved with this framework and what questions remain open.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have presented a novel perspective on the scientific method by
formalizing <strong>scientific discovery as a recursive modal projection
process</strong>. In this account, a scientific theory continually
defines its own tests and transforms in response to the results, weaving
deduction and induction into a single recursive thread. Our formal
framework introduced a hypothesis space <span
class="math inline"><em>H</em></span>, a set of modalities <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em></span>, a projection operator <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> for generating predictions, and an
update operator <span class="math inline"><em>U</em></span> for revising
hypotheses. Through this lens, we can view familiar concepts of
validation, falsification, and paradigm change within one unified
dynamic model. Each cycle of theory and experiment is one iteration of a
fundamentally never-ending procedure aimed at aligning our ideas with
the multifaceted reality they seek to explain.</p>
<p><strong>Key insights and contributions</strong> of this framework
include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unified Process:</strong> The recursive loop integrates
the creation of predictions and the assimilation of evidence. This
emphasizes that progress comes not from induction or deduction alone but
from their interplay. The formalism captures this unity elegantly in the
composition <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> ↦ <em>P</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>m</em>) ↦ <em>U</em>(<em>h</em>,<em>o</em>) ↦ <em>h</em>′</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modal Realism:</strong> By explicitly incorporating
modalities, we acknowledge that how and where we test a theory matters.
This highlights the importance of developing new methods of observation
and experiment, as each new modality can reveal new dimensions of
validity or flaw in our hypotheses. Truly robust theories prove
themselves across many modalities, reflecting a deep consistency with
reality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gradual vs. Radical Change:</strong> The framework
accounts for continuous refinement of theories as well as occasional
scientific revolutions, showing them to be extremes of the same process.
Incremental updates correspond to the day-to-day honing of theory, while
paradigm shifts correspond to the model’s ability to leap to a distant
point in hypothesis space when needed. This resolves the apparent
dichotomy between cumulative and revolutionary views of scientific
progress by embedding them in one recursive narrative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophical Clarity:</strong> Our approach casts new
light on longstanding philosophical discussions. It supports a
fallibilist and anti-foundational view: no theory is ever final, and
knowledge grows by correcting errors. Yet it also supports a realist
optimism: because there is structure in reality, our iterative
corrections tend to bring us closer to truth (even if asymptotically).
It reframes questions about truth and objectivity into questions about
the breadth of modalities a theory can span and the stability of its
fixed points under recursive refinement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflexivity and Extension:</strong> We recognized that
this theory of discovery can itself be tested and improved in a
meta-scientific recursion, and that similar recursive projection
principles might guide intelligent discovery processes in machines. This
suggests a wide applicability of the concept, from understanding human
epistemic endeavors to engineering artificial ones.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, the vision of scientific discovery as recursive modal
projection celebrates both the <strong>structured rationality</strong>
and the <strong>open-ended creativity</strong> of science. It portrays
scientists as engaged in a profound dialogue with nature: they project
their ideas onto the world in myriad ways, and the world answers each
projection with feedback, sometimes affirming, sometimes surprising.
Through listening and adapting to this feedback, our ideas grow closer
to capturing the patterns of reality. Yet, like an endless conversation,
this process has no final word—there are always new modes to explore,
new questions to ask, and thus always room for new discovery. This
framework encourages us to embrace the recursive journey, understanding
that the power of science lies not in absolute certainty, but in its
remarkable capacity to continuously reinvent and improve itself. It is a
formal ode to the never-ending quest for knowledge, one modal projection
at a time.</p>
