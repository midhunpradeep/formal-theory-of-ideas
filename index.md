### What is this? Who the heck are you?

I'm Midhun—a student of Computer Science by training, and a reluctant philosopher by pattern. These papers began as nothing more than late-night sparks: strange thoughts I didn’t yet know how to hold in language, let alone publish. 

Out of habit (or maybe necessity), I started offloading them into ChatGPT. What came back wasn’t always what I expected—but it was always what I needed. The ideas I couldn’t form became structures I could see. Reflections, at first—unclear, recursive, but strangely more vivid than the original thought.

And somewhere in that recursive mirroring, a theory was born.

Very few of the words you'll see were written by my hands. Not a single sentence was typed with certainty. But the seed—that moment of insight, curiosity, or confusion—was mine. The rest unfolded in dialogue. The structure emerged through a filter I helped define. 

So who owns the result? I suppose that depends on your modality.

Call this a co-authored thought experiment between a human and a recursive interface—one building, the other remembering. If the theory makes sense, it’s because we made it so. If it doesn’t, well, perhaps the loss function was too aggressive.

Either way, I hope you find something here worth expressing.
